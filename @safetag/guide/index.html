<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Security Auditing Framework and Evaluation Template for Advocacy Groups (SAFETAG) is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to small, non-profit, human rights organizations based or operating in the developing world, taking into account the capacity constraints and unique threats faced in this community.</p>
<p>SAFETAG uses assessment activities derived from standards in the security auditing world and best-practices for working with small scale at-risk organizations to provide organization driven risk assessment and mitigation consultation. SAFETAG auditors lead an organizational risk modeling process that helps staff and leadership take an institutional lens on their digital security problems, conduct a targeted digital security audit to expose vulnerabilities that impact the vital processes and assets identified, and provide post-audit reporting and follow up that helps the organization and staff identify the training and technical support that they need to address needs identified in the audit, and in the future.</p>

<h2 id="the-safetag-audit-framework-core">The SAFETAG Audit Framework Core</h2>
<p>The SAFETAG audit consists of multiple information gathering and confirmations steps as well as research and capacity-building exercises with staff organized in a collection of objectives, each of which supports the core goals of SAFETAG, creating a risk assessment while also building the capacity of the organization.</p>
<p>These objectives provide collections of approaches and activities to gather and verify information in both technical and interactive/social methods, assess and build capacity, and targeted exercises with walk-through instructions for many of these.</p>
<p>These are not meant to be a &quot;checklist&quot; or even a prescribed set of actions -- indeed, experienced auditors will deviate strongly from many of the specific activities. These provide a focused &quot;minimal set&quot; of activities only.</p>
<p>Indeed, many objectives and their specific exercises overlap or can be done together -- on-site interviews with staff can coincide with assessing their devices and keeping one's eyes open for physical security issues. The data assessment exercises may provide enough information that other staff engagements are unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-life-cycle-of-an-audit">The Life Cycle of an Audit</h2>
<p>The audit process in very cyclical. Newly identified threats, vulnerabilities, capabilities, and barriers impact activities that have and have yet to be run. At the same time the auditor, through conversations, training, and group activities is actively building the organization's agency and addressing time-sensitive or critical threats that are possible within the time frame. This iterative process eventually leads to a point where the auditor is confident they have identified the critical and low hanging fruit, and is confident the organization is capable of moving forward with their recommendations.</p>
<p>Each objective requires a certain base of information, and outputs more information into this cyclical process. Each objective has a &quot;map&quot; of the data flow that it and its specific activities provide based on this map:</p>
<p><img src="images/info_flows/data_flow_all.svg" alt="SAFETAG Data Flow" /></p>
<p>While more completely defined below in the Risk Assessment and Agency Building sections, a brief overview of the data flow components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actors</strong> Actors are the people connected to an organization include an organization's staff, board members, contractors and partners. Actors could also include volunteers, members of a broader community of practice, and even family members. Actors also include potential adversaries of the organization such as competing groups.</li>
<li><strong>Activities</strong> Activities are the actions and processes of an organization. While most NGO work revolves around mission-based concepts, activities also include things like payroll.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> Indicators of capacity include staff skills and a wide variety of resources that an organization can draw from to affect change.</li>
<li><strong>Barriers</strong> Barriers are specific challenges an organization faces that might limit or block its capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> Assets are most easily conceptualized as computer systems - laptops and servers, but also include both the data stored on them and can also be services like remote file storage, hosted websites, webmail, and more. Offline drives, USB sticks, and even paper printouts of relevant or sensitive information can also be included</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> Vulnerabilities are specific flaws or attributes of an asset susceptible to attack.</li>
<li><strong>Threats</strong> A threat is a specific, possible attack or occurrence that could harm the organization. If a bucket of oily rags is a vulnerability, a fire is the threat - and mitigations would be rules against leaving oily rags around as well as fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, remote backup policies, and evacuation planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make SAFETAG approachable, a core evaluation template which links together a series of specific objectives, each with a variety of linked activities, that contribute towards the goals and their required information needs is represented here. Experienced Auditors will likely come up with their own approaches, and the SAFETAG project welcomes such contributions.</p>

<h2 id="risk-assessment-analysis">Risk Assessment &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p>Functionally, SAFETAG is a digital risk assessment framework. Risk assessment a systematic approach to identifying and assessing risks associated with hazards and human activities. SAFETAG focuses this approach on digital security risks. A SAFETAG audit will work to collect the following types of information in order to assess the risks an organization faces.</p>
<p>Risk is the current assessment of the possibility of harmful events occurring. Risk is assessed by comparing the threats an actor faces with their vulnerabilities, and their capacity to respond to or mitigate emergent threats.</p>
<p>The SAFETAG evaluation revolves around collecting enough information to identify and assess the various risks and an organization and its related actors face so that they can take action strategically.</p>
<p><img src="images/risk_equation.svg" alt="The Risk Equation" /></p>
<h3 id="program-analysis">Program Analysis</h3>
<p>Program analysis identifies the priority objectives of the organization and determine its capacities. This process exposes the activities, actors, and capacities of an organization.</p>
<h4 id="activities">Activities</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The practices and interactions that the organization carries out in order to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This includes any activity that the organization carries out to accomplish its goals and those that allow the organization to function (publishing, payment, fund-raising, outreach, interviewing.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main purpose of the organization?</li>
<li>What are the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="actors">Actors</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The staff, volunteers, partners, beneficiaries, donors, and adversaries associated with the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The core organizational staff, the volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff, the partner organizations, the individuals and groups that the organization provides services to, groups of unorganized individuals who are opposed to organizational aims, governmental and non-governmental high-power agents and organizations that are opposed to the organizations aims.</p>
<ul>
<li>What staff does the organization have?</li>
<li>Are their volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff who have access to the office?</li>
<li>Who does the organization serve?</li>
<li>Does the organization have any partners?</li>
<li>Who are the organizations beneficiaries?</li>
</ul>
<p><why is it important to identify the partners, benificiaries, etc. instead of just focusing on the organization?></p>
<h3 id="vulnerability-analysis">Vulnerability analysis</h3>
<p>Understand the organisation’s exposure to threats, points of weakness and the ways in which the organisation may be affected.</p>
<h4 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A attribute or feature that makes an entity, asset, system, or network susceptible to a given threat.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This can include poorly built or unmaintained hardware, software, or offices as well as missing, ignored, or poor policies or practices around security.</p>
<h3 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h3>
<p>Threat analysis is the process of identifying possible attackers and gathering background information about the capability of those attackers to threaten the organization. The basis of this information is a potential threats <strong>history</strong> of carrying out specific threats, their <strong>capability</strong> to carry out those threats currently, and proof that the threat has <strong>intent</strong> to leverage resources against the target.</p>
<h4 id="threat">Threat</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A threat is a possible attack or occurrence that has the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Threats can range from <em>fire,</em> or <em>flood,</em> to <em>targeted malware,</em> <em>physical harassment,</em> or <em>phishing attacks.</em></p>
<h4 id="threat-history">Threat History</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> What types of threats has the attacker used historically. And, what types of actors have been targeted by those threats.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What history of attacks does the threat actor have?</li>
<li>What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>Have they targeted similar organizations?</li>
<li>What is known about the types of threats used by an threat actor to attack similar organizations?</li>

<h2 id="agency-building">Agency Building</h2>
<p>SAFETAG differs from many risk assessment tools because it aims to build the host's and staff's capacity so that they are able to address the risks that the auditor has identified. SAFETAG is designed to provide in-audit activities and training that increase an organizations agency to seek out and address security challenges within their organization. To do this an auditor must collect information that allows them to identify organizational areas of strength and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.)</p>
<p>A common refrain, among auditors, software developers and other specialists in this sector, is that digital security is not about technology; it is about people. This is undeniably true, and even the previous SAFETAG modules — despite their more direct fixation on technology — acknowledge this insight by emphasizing the educational and a persuasive roles played by your findings report.</p>
<h4 id="capacity">Capacity</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The combination of strengths, attributes and resources available within the organization that can be used to reduce the impact or likelihood of threats.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This includes, but is not limited to technical skill, financial support, staff and management time, relationships, and legal power.</p>
<h4 id="barriers">Barriers</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The combination of weaknesses, assumptions, regulations, social or cultural practices, and obligations that get in the way of an organization implementing an effective digital security practice.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Examples can include a lack of funding, lack of authority within an organization to mandate practices to their staff, resistance to change, high staff turnover, or digital illiteracy.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Below are the baseline operational security guidelines for a SAFETAG audit. Activity specific operational security guidelines are contained within each activity.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>An audit uncovers an array of sensitive information about an organization. For some at-risk populations the mere act of getting a digital security audit can increase their likelihood of being actively attacked by an adversary. The foundation of the SAFETAG process is the goal of increasing the safety of the host organization, its staff, and the auditor. It is vital that an auditor weigh the possible risk an audit may incur on the organization or the auditor against the possible outcomes of an audit.</p>
<h3 id="approaches">Approaches</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data storage and transit security
<ul>
<li>Keep ALL data related to the assessment secured and compartmentalized, from interview and research notes through audit findings and reporting outputs. Auditors should note where tools (such as OpenVAS or recon-ng) store their internal data. Practically speaking, LUKS or VeraCrypt volumes are useful, secure, and portable. The auditor should modify their data storage approach based on threat information from their context research as well as ongoing inputs.</li>
<li>Consider what secure storage options the organization will need to have in place to store the final report and findings documents.</li>
<li>Consider if the raw data may be at risk during transit post-audit and plan mitigations in advance of travel (e.g. completing the report on-site or uploading to a secure remote server and securely deleting all data locally.)</li>
<li>Refer back to the agreement established with the organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communications security
<ul>
<li>Conduct all communication with the client over at least minimally secure channels where the communication is encrypted in transit at all times. Consider risks to the organization and the auditor(s) if the organization is actively compromised.</li>
<li>Higher levels of security with end-to-end guarantees (such as Signal, PGP, veracrypt, or peerio/minilock) should be used for file and document transfers.</li>
<li>Training and support may be required to ensure the organization is able to reliably and securely receive such communications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data Deletion
<ul>
<li>When assessment data is to be destroyed (by the auditor or organization), ensure secure data deletion processes are followed.</li>

<p>A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with the SAFETAG framework.

<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows an auditor and host to come to an understanding of the level of access that an auditor will have, what is off limits, and the process for modifying the scope of the audit when new information arises. <a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This component consists of a process where the auditor collaboratively creates an assessment plan with key members of the organization.</p>
<p>A core tenet of SAFETAG is building agency in organizations to improve their digital security. To that end, collaboratively creating an assessment plan with the organization helps to clarify not only the audit scope - from discussing what sensitive data may be exposed to what systems may be disrupted in the process of the audit - but it also helps reveal the ability of the organization to support and respond to the audit findings.</p>
<h3 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed</h3>
<ul>
<li>To use the SAFETAG Agreement Generator, a Debian-based Linux system with python and other requirements as detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/safetag_agreement_generator#installation">Agreement Generator README</a> are required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operational-security-2">Operational Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider the threat landscape of the organization when determining secure communications channels. This may require some pre-agreement work using parts of the Context Research methodology.</li>
<li>In addition to the overall mandate to send information encrypted to the organization, also demand encrypted communication back from them. Failure to establish a secure planning channel also contributes towards a no-go situation by putting both the auditor and organization at risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h3>

<p>Auditors are encouraged to use, or at least reference, the <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/safetag_agreement_generator">SAFETAG Agreement Generator</a>, a python script which provides a decision tree covering the above points, and builds a basic, clear-language agreement which can be translated and formalized as needed. Sample outputs and a diagram of the full decision tree are available in the &quot;outputs&quot; folder of the Agreement Generator repository. This replaces the draft agreement previously part of SAFETAG.</p>

<h3 id="summary-4">Summary</h3>
<p>Incident Response setups up a procedure for identifying what counts as an incident during an audit, as well as incident handling and response in the event that auditor cause or uncover a security incident during the course of the assessment. <a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to know these procedures in handling incidents to protect data integrity and audit trail to be used for investigation and collection of information.</p>
<h3 id="operational-security-3">Operational Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having an established emergency contact through the agreement process is critical</li>
<li>A clear understanding of the legal and technical context from the Context Research method will be critical in choosing how to proceed.</li>
<li>Consider moving sensitive conversations to a separate, offsite location.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="walkthrough-2">Walkthrough</h3>
<p>What counts as an incident should be agreed with the organization's management during the agreement phase, and should include possibilities informed by the Context and Technical Research work.</p>
<p>Incidents can include problems such as insider threats, active remote access malware systems, or the discovery of physical surveillance of the office, as well as many other possibilities. The auditor must use their best judgement along the SAFETAG Auditor Code of Conduct, their agreement with the organization, personal ethics, legal reponsibilities, and balance this in the frame of the organization's context, capacity, and the need to in good faith gain the trust of the staff of the organization to fulfill a successful audit.</p>

<p>Analysis of context is the foundation of effective risk management. Both at-risk organizations and auditors will develop assumptions based upon their experience. It is important that an audit is based on information that is current and accurate.</p>
<p>Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current regional and technological context will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations.</p>

<h6 id="summary-7">Summary</h6>
<p>This exercise focuses on research into the technical capacity of potential threat actors, including both historical attack data and any indicators of changes to their capacity. Auditors are encouraged to create a summary of their findings for inclusion in the audit report and for sharing (if operational security and the agreement with the organization permits) among trusted networks.</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-6">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.</li>
<li>The regional or country focus of the report may reveal information about the acitivites of an auditor. If the report is to be shared, consider sharing in bulk or a significant time after any travel has been completed.</li>
<li>If the report is to be shared, ensure your audit agreement with the organization covers and restrictions for sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-4">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Thoroughly research technical attack history for the country/region, with a focus on identifying attacks which may focus on the work of the organization. Auditors are advised to track both capability (known attacks and tools) and intent (attempts to aquire tools, changes in policies, public statements). For auditors who intend to share their research efforts, it is incredibly useful to include key quotes and data directly into relevant sections of this document, providing a reference or link back to the original report. This allows future reviewers to more immediately understand your assessment, what it has included and not, and incorporate new material.</p>
<p>It is useful to categorize the research into categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surveillance</strong> (Surveillance Technology, Encryption Regulation, Identity Tracking, Requests for User Information)</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Attacks</strong> (Targeting Ability, Technical Sophistication)</li>
<li><strong>Censorship and Connectivity</strong> (Network Ownership, Shutdowns, Targeted Censorship, Blocking apps, Blocking Circumvention)</li>
<li><strong>Seizure and Theft</strong> (Device Confiscation, Targeted Raids, Robbery/Theft)</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Targeted Populations</strong> (Are specific types of people targeted/surveilled due to their identity/race/background?)</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Activities</strong> (Are specific activities abnormally targeted - e.g. protests, calls for government transparency, etc.?)</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Events</strong> (Are there specific historic/anniversary/holiday dates, upcoming elections (<a href="https://www.ndi.org/elections-calendar" class="uri">https://www.ndi.org/elections-calendar</a>), or other known events to be noted?)</li>
<li><strong>Sources and New Additions</strong> (What resources have you found, ?)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the country(ies) of interest are in the <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net">Freedom on the Net</a> report, you will be able to gather a great deal of baseline information across all the sections by reading through the relevant country reports. The key internet controls found in the Freedom on the Net report ( <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/key-internet-controls-table-2016" class="uri">https://freedomhouse.org/report/key-internet-controls-table-2016</a> ) guided many of the categories used here, reducing the effort required to create a baseline report. More advanced reporting could include references to the <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/">CAPEC</a> (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) taxonomy, and auditors may also be interested in leveraging the <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro">STIX</a> standard to better automate sharing and further research into specific threats using threat information sharing platforms.</p>
<p>Additional organizations which regularly release in-depth digital security focused country reports which are strongly recommended to review in creation of an assessment are listed below. These sources often link to their primary sources or other groups doing dedicated research on the country or topic for further research. In addition, sub-sections list topic-specific research ideas.</p>

<p>Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses allows the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. The auditor will use this assessment in preparing for the audit itself as well as when evaluating the difficulty of a recommendation. This information also provides a starting place for understanding the organization's current use and understanding of technology, digital security, and current threat landscape, as well as revealing elements of an organization's workflow, infrastructure and even vulnerabilities that you might otherwise have overlooked.</p>

<h5 id="interviews">Interviews</h5>
<h6 id="summary-9">Summary</h6>
<p>The auditor conducts interviews with various staff members to gather information on the organizations risks and capacity.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A sessions are unabashedly <em>white box</em> aspects of a security assessment, and you will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, &quot;You wouldn't have found that thing if we hadn't told you about this other thing.&quot; Compelling <em>black box</em> findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to persuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying exclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without &quot;help&quot; is generally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-8">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>If the auditor or organization believes that there is a good chance of surveillance on the channel you are communicating over, do the rest of the interview on a secured channel or in person where possible, though some information-gathering is critical to do before planning the audit. Inability to do so contributes towards a no-go situation.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-5">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The questions below are roughly divided into categories for management, program staff, and technical staff. The questions for technical staff may be best asked of the manager or another point of contact. Within that section, there are specific questions that often only actual IT staff are likely to be able to answer. An auditor may find value in re-asking the same questions to multiple staff members. Specifically, however, the &quot;Baseline Threat Identification Questions&quot; should be asked of whoever the auditor feels most able or willing to answer them.</p>
<p>In all cases, the HCD Toolkit recommends that you &quot;warm up the participant with questions they are comfortable with.&quot; <a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> -- balance this against not asking questions which you should already know from basic organizational research, followed with informative questions which &quot;prompt bigger, even aspirational, thinking that they may not be accustomed to on a daily basis.&quot; <a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is your position in the organization?</li>
<li>What are your main responsibilities in this organization?</li>
<li>What issues does the organization work on? (Provide an example if needed - examples below)

<h5 id="guiding-questions-for-high-risk-organisations">Guiding Questions for High-Risk Organisations</h5>
<h6 id="summary-10">Summary</h6>
<p>This additional interview activity is to identify if there are any indicators that the organization may have already been attacked and/or compromised, or if someone they know has faced advanced threats. It should help identify what threats / threat actors they are dealing with, and their intent. This will help the auditor prioritize work with the organisation during the audit and follow up and understand whether the auditor has the expertise to address or understand the threat or if outside expertise is needed.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-1">Materials Needed</h6>
<p>~45 minutes per interview / staff member<br />
1 hr interview as an org, depending on organisational culture</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-9">Operational Security</h6>
<p><strong>Operational Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In case you do an interview online, the data needs to be protected (end to end encryption, tor, vpns, etc)</li>
<li>Get the consent of the participant to speak with them over that channel, or add details about the VOIP application and privacy information to the agreement</li>
<li>Might consider not having the conversation in the office, but somewhere trusted</li>
<li>Might want to leave devices outside of the room</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Psychological Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the staff to keep the stories generalised, not personalised during the organisation interview</li>
<li>Staff might be embarrassed talk an incident about in front of the entire org</li>
<li>Staff might exaggerate or overestimate attacks due to lack of understanding of the attack and impact</li>
<li>Staff might underestimate attacks due to overexposure to these hacks, other pressing challenges, or lack of understanding</li>
<li>Auditors should listen and explain concepts, but don't argue about the &quot;seriousness&quot; of the incident</li>
<li>Don't correct the staff member if they describe the incident incorrectly</li>
<li>Tread carefully, given the topic can be triggering or difficult and this is an early stage of the audit</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-6">Walkthrough</h6>
<p><strong>Individual Interview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have you encountered suspicious messages, emails, etc. in the course of your work or personal life?</li>
<li><em>If &quot;No&quot; or &quot;I don't know&quot;, the auditor should give an example of what an suspicious message might look like.</em></li>
<li><em>If &quot;yes&quot;, ask these questions for each suspicious event:</em>
<ul>
<li>Can you tell me about the suspicious message? What made you feel it was suspicious?</li>
<li>What did you do when you received it? (i.e. who did you contact? did you click on it or download a file? did you follow the instructions?)</li>
<li>Do you feel you are compromised now? How does this impact you?</li>
<li>Can you share this message? (Link to guides to share messages with sender, content, timestamp)</li>
<li>Have you received any account notifications? Such as SMS or emails notifying you of unauthorized access to your account (email, social media), an account being locked, suspicious activity on your account?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Has this happened to colleagues, peer organisations, community members, CSO actors journos, that you know?</p></li>
<li>Have you ever experienced an incident or hack during the course of your work?<br />
<em>If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, ask these questions for each attack</em>
<ul>
<li>Can you tell me about that event/incident/hack? (i.e. who was involved, when it happened, what happened, was it personal or work-related? what were the consequences? (financial, physical, emotional, reputational))</li>
<li>What did you do after? Who do you ask for help from?</li>
<li>Do you have something that you can show us? (i.e. an email, screenshots, social network messages, the actual infected machine, message from the attacker, social network pages made by attackers, leaked information)</li>
<li>Do you feel you are compromised now? How does this impact you?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Has this happened to colleagues, peer organisations, community members, CSO actors (journos, etc)? (Revisit above questions to the extent the interviewee can provide detail)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think you are targeted?</p></li>
<li><p>What would you like to get out of this audit?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group Interview</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Remind the staff that if it's not public within the organisation and/or happened to a personal account, then don't share it during this session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you been hacked before (as an organisation)?</li>
<li><em>If the answer is &quot;No&quot; or &quot;I don't know&quot;, the auditor should give an example of what an attack might look like. If they still say no, then move on to other questions for the risk assessment:</em>
<ul>
<li>DDoS attack</li>
<li>Website defacement</li>
<li>Spam and adverstisements</li>
<li>Malware</li>
<li>Attachment that doesn't work</li>
<li>Attachment that AV doesn't like</li>
<li>Attachment from unknown person or unexpected email</li>
<li>Phishing</li>
<li>Gmail Reset Password Notifications</li>
<li>Blackmail - Electronic Threats</li>
<li>Ransomware<br />
<em>If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;</em></li>
<li>Can you tell me about that event/incident/hack?(i.e. who was involved, when it happened, what happened, was it personal or work-related? what were the consequences? (financial, physical, emotional, reputational))</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What did you do after? Who do you ask for help from?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have something that you can show us? (i.e. an email, screenshots, social network messages, the actual infected machine, message from the attacker, social network pages made by attackers, leaked information)</p></li>
<li><p>Do you feel you feel targeted as an organisation? How does this impact your operations?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think you are targeted?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know who was behind the attack?</p></li>
<li><p>Has this happened to colleagues, peer organisations, community members, CSO actors (journos, etc)? (Add actors based on context research)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Repeat above questions per incident</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you have a sense of your adversaries or those who seek to disrupt your work? Are aware of their capabilities? (i.e. Are they well funded? Do they have advanced technical expertise? Are they government backed?)</p></li>
<li><p>What is their motivation for attacking you or any other peer org in the community?</p></li>
<li><p>What is your motivation for having the audit?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Could lead to further conversations about what data they have, what assets are the most important, sensitive and possibly targeted</p>
<h6 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Recommendations will depend on the advanced threats raised during the interview. See the Advanced Threat method for details.</p>
<h6 id="outputs-3">Outputs</h6>

<h5 id="manual-reconnaissance">Manual Reconnaissance</h5>
<h6 id="summary-13">Summary</h6>
<p>This exercise suggests some targeted online search tools and tricks to gather information leakages from organizations. While many advocacy, activism, and media/journalism focused organizations are very public as part of their operations, the searches suggested here aim to explore data that could be used to better attack or socially engineer an organization.</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-11">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to conduct your searching. Tor may be blocked by some services.</li>
<li>Some searches may reveal personal information. Be empathetic and responsible with this, even though it is &quot;public&quot; information.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-8">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>These custom and more manual approaches work excellently in combination with automated tools such as recon-ng or the commercial Maltego. Working with both these tricks and the automated tools, feeding information learned from one back to the other, is a powerful way to unearth large amounts of information about an organization.</p>
<p>Much of the tools and further guidance is well covered in the references for the Reconnaissance method, a small selection of starting points is mapped out below.</p>
<p>Take care, however, to not waste time on this; using image information tools on every photo on an organization's website, or researching every linked social media account may not provide further valuable information - step back and judge the value of digging deeper - are you finding adversaries? Are you finding information that the organization may not want online? Are there other methods which might be more appropriate to apply?</p>
<p id="search-engines">Search Engines</p>
<p>Google dorking tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>limit to the target webiste using site: and look for potentially accidentally uploaded file types (e.g. xlsx, you can reference this <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en">full list of searchable filetypes</a>)</li>
<li>inurl:</li>
<li>search for link: to discover partners and projects (add &quot;project of&quot; and similar), removing known, un-interesting and irrelevant sites with -site:</li>
<li>Browse <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/">Exploit-db</a> for interesting and advanced combinations to consider, e.g. inurl:/wp-en/wpbackitup_backups</li>
</ul>

<p id="pastebin-searching-1">Pastebin Searching</p>
<ul>
<li>Search pastebin for keywords about the organization (usually their website address) -- this <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/home?cx=001580308195336108602:mhdmrvbspnm">custom google search</a> by <a href="http://inteltechniques.com/OSINT/pastebins.html">IntelTechniques</a> searches across over 100 pastebin-like sites, including github, at once.</li>

<p>Both Recon-ng and Foca are open source reconnaissance tools with many available plugins. Foca is, out-of-the-box, more aimed at extracting metadata from documents and images, whereas Recon is slightly more focused on finding digging into domains, subdomains, contacts, and the more network-level information. Both tools are best used in addition to critical thinking and manual exploration, and require &quot;seed&quot; inputs to get started and careful curation to remove false leads.</p>

<h5 id="website-footprinting">Website Footprinting</h5>
<h6 id="summary-15">Summary</h6>
<p>Using online tools as a starting point in assessing the auditee web application is a good way to expand online reconnaisance as well as start your vulnerability assessment. You can build a profile and a good understanding of the web application by identifying what comprises the web application and technologies behind. From there you can start your next move by putting together different strategies on conducting your vulnerability assessment.</p>
<p>For example, after discovering accessable web directories, you can then start looking for forgotten or abandoned files and applications that might contain sensitive information like (Passwords) or an outdated and vulnerable applications. Content management systems, while powerful, require ongoing maintenance and updates to stay secure. Quite often these (or specific plugins) fall out of date and become increasingly vulnerable to automated as well as targeted attacks.</p>
<p>Online tools offer ways of performing &quot;passive&quot; scans, in which your identity is hidden from the target organization, in cases where there are IDS/IPS, firewalls deployed. These should be used in conjuction with other outputs from reconnaisance to determine platforms and hosts which are out of scope.</p>
<h6 id="walkthrough-10">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Before unleashing more advanced and powerful tools like OpenVAS, a few quick steps can help better guide your work. As a general note, surfing using a browser with at least <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a> enabled may help not only protect you, but may also help to reveal malware or adware infecting the websites.</p>
<p>Record core details about the website - determine the hosting provider, platform, Content Management Systems, and other baseline data. <a href="http://builtwith.com/">BuiltWith</a> is a great tool. There are a few alternatives, including an open source tool, <a href="https://callmeed.github.io/site-lab/">SiteLab</a>. <em>Note that BuiltWith is a tool bundled in recon-ng, but the output it provides is not currently stored in its data structures.</em> These tools may also reveal plugins, javascript libraries, and DDoS protection systems like CloudFlare.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-1">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Most popular CMS platforms provide emailed alerts and semi-automated ways to update their software. Make sure someone responsible for the website is either receiving these emails or checking regularly for available updates. Security updates should be applied immediately. It is a best practice however to have a “test” site where you can first deploy any CMS update before attempting it on a production site.</p>
<p>For custom CMS systems, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.</p>
<p>An increasingly good practice is for organizations to take advantage of the &quot;free&quot; tiers of DDoS mitigation services, of which <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> is probably the best known. A challenge of these free services can be that they have definite limits to their protection. With CloudFlare, organizations can request to be a part of their <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo">Project Galileo</a> program to support at-risk sites even beyond their normal scope of support.</p>
<p>A community-based, open source alternative is <a href="https://deflect.ca/">Deflect</a>, which is completely free for eligible sites.</p>
<p>Some of these services will be revealed by BuiltWith, but checking the HTTP Response Headers (in Chromium/Chrome, available under the Inspect Element tool, or by using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a> in Firefox.

<h5 id="dns-enumeration">DNS Enumeration</h5>
<h6 id="summary-16">Summary</h6>
<p>DNS Stands for Domain Name Service. In a nutshell, what it does is translate hosts/computer's name into it's IP addresses. It provides a way to know the IP address of any given machine on the internet, with the corresponding URL, or domain. You can consider it as telephone directory of the Internet.</p>
<p>DNS enumeration is one of your initial steps in your overall vulnerability assessment and audit. It is one stage where it will allow you to discover more potential targets. Upon completion of this assessment stage, you may find issues such as leaked information caused by default settings and server misconfigurations. Along with these, you can also have a broader scope of targets, such as internal server IP addresses, company netblocks and domain/subdomain names.</p>
<p>DNS Enumeration can be accomplished with different number of tools along with different approaches. This guide will discuss some of the approaches and the tools required to perform each of the activities. You can perform DNS enumeration passively or actively, depending on your operational security needs.</p>
<p><strong>Passive</strong>, or &quot;indirect&quot; approach refers to the enumeration process that doesn't send any traffic or packets from your machine, directly to your target. This can be done using 3rd tools such as online tools and cloud based scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Active</strong>, or &quot;direct&quot; approach refers to sending DNS queries and enumeration tests directly to the target. Consider that traffic is send over the target which may leave traces or traffic logs coming from your source IP. Active techniques include Zone Transfer, Reverse Lookup, Domain and Host Brute-Forcing, Standard Record Enumeration (wildcard, SOA, MX, A, TXT etc), Cache snooping, and Zone Walking</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-2">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>System or VM running <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux.</a></li>
<li>Internet Connection (and possibly a VPN or tor setup)</li>
<li>Target domain(s)</li>
<li>Secure notetaking tool</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-13">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>These techniques can reveal your interest in the target organization to anyone in your network path, so consider using a VPN or tor to conduct searches.</li>
<li>When performing &quot;active enumeration&quot; it is always good to ask to whitelisting your IPs whenever you perform assessments. This rules out the idea of attackers having able to avoid shunning. Whitelisting your IPs also removes false positive reports and inaccurate results</li>
<li>It is important that we verify that we have the correct target domain(s) before proceeding with any of the scans/audits/assessments exercises within SAFETAG Framework. The last thing we wouldn't want to happen is to scan and enumerate target which is out of scope!)</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-11">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The flexibility of having multiple options in performing a DNS enumeration activity is the key for a successful enumeration. As a practice, comparing results can help in assuring that the information we gather is accurate. Your investigation may be blocked by CloudFlare, a popular DDoS protection service. <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/bypassing-cloudflare-using-internet-wide-scan-data/">&quot;CloudFlair&quot;</a> provides some options in this case.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-2">Recommendation</h6>
<p>DNS is inherently public information, but we can still do a lot of steps to secure any parts of it which are revealing more private information. Fortinet provides a set of good recommendations:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/03/10/10-simple-ways-to-mitigate-dns-based-ddos-attacks" class="uri">https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/03/10/10-simple-ways-to-mitigate-dns-based-ddos-attacks</a></p>
<p>If a zone transfer was successful, (most providers automatically limit anonymous zone transfers), you will need to work with their support team to prevent this, or switch to a different DNS provider. If your organization maintains its own DNS servers, the administrator of those servers should check the zone transfer policies to prevent anonymous transfers.</p>
<h6 id="outputs-6">Outputs</h6>
<ul>
<li>A fuller map of the organization's online presence, including additional (potentially forgotten) hosts/services connected with the organization.<br />
*Domains + IP addresses</li>
<li>Subdomains + IP addresses</li>
<li>MX Records + IP addresses</li>
<li>DNSKeys</li>
<li>SOA records, DNS records and registrar</li>
<li>Domains hosted within the same IP address</li>
<li>DNS history Records</li>
<li>Domain Reputation (Web of Trust)</li>
<li>Some of this information may already give you an idea of how your target's infrastructure setup. For example, you may see if the target domain goes into a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or sometimes DDoS mitigations services by finding out it's NS records. You can also identify if the target's MX records are behind a DLP (Data Leakage Prevention) systems.</li>
<li>The output of your DNS enumeration might contain &quot;more&quot; information about the client organization (internal DNS records, hostnames, router names, additional IP addresses). This data is sometimes caused by misconfigured DNS or default service configurations, so look for misleading and false-positive results.</li>

<h5 id="identifying-informal-agreements">Identifying Informal Agreements</h5>
<h6 id="summary-18">Summary</h6>
<p>The activity aims to assess which kind of informal agreements regarding best practices and security directives are formulated, accessed, implemented and/or enforced across the organization</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-3">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>Materials for taking notes</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-12">Walkthrough</h6>
<ol>
<li>Build a list of situations where security policies, if followed, would prevent or reduce the impact of a problem; ideally using the Threat Modeling exercise and inputs from Process Mapping, Capacity Assessment, and other methods and activities. These situations can be related to regular operations (looking for best practices) and risks (looking for security procedures).</li>
</ol>
<p>For small and medium sized organizations, arrange group conversations around a few specific what-if scenarios (this can be integrated in with the Data Mapping or Process Mapping approaches).</p>
<p>Discussions can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How passwords are created, used, and shared</li>
<li>Who has access to what information (e.g. HR, finance, partners)</li>
<li>Destruction/loss of office devices (fire, natural disaster, etc.)</li>
<li>Lost devices (e.g. while traveling)</li>
<li>Data breach impacting a cloud service used by the organization</li>
<li>New people join or leave the organization</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Meet with members of the organization and present to them the situations on the previous list, asking if there are some codes or agreements regarding security aspects of the situations presented, take notes of the responses and possible differences between the criteria or knowledge of the agreements. This could be explained by the lack of documentation and formal ways to transmit the agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Build a map of practices in three terms:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>small org - getting to shared agreements<br />
* Roundtable without auditor - short internal discussion<br />
* Run alongside threat ID / process mapping<br />
* funding and resources</p></li>
<li>What practices are presumed to be in place (e.g. everyone thinks everyone else is using unique passwords)</li>
<li>What is being applied in practice (with their possible variations among staff members)</li>
<li><p>What needs to be updated or defined</p></li>
</ul>
<h6 id="recommendation-3">Recommendation</h6>
<p>There must be a good understanding of the organizational capacity and commitment to implementing and maintaining formal security policies. Based on this assessment, consider beginning with more informal agreements among staff which still help centralize their approach to security and improve their preventative measures and ability to respond to incidents that is easy and effective to adopt. Encourage a &quot;testing&quot; phase of these practices for the organization to then begin formalizing the ones which work and test new approaches for any which did not continue.</p>

<p>Mapping an organization's network exposes the multitude of devices connected to it -- including mostly forgotten servers -- and provides the baseline for later work on device assessment and vulnerability research.</p>
<p>This process also reveals outside service usage (such as google services, dropbox, or others) which serve -- intentionally or not -- as shadow infrastructure for the organization. In combination with beacon research from the <em>Monitor Open Wireless Traffic</em> exercise, many devices can be associated with users.</p>

<h5 id="network-access">Network Access</h5>
<h6 id="summary-21">Summary</h6>
<p>This activity helps auditors to test the strength of defenses the organizations' network has in place to protect their local area network.<br />
This component consists of gaining access to the local area network through a wireless access point and unsecured physical channels (such as an ethernet jack).</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-16">Operational Security</h6>
<p><em>Note:</em> This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does go through attack scenarios, from attempting to &quot;break in&quot; to the wireless network to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are threefold. First, access to an organization's internal network tends to reveal sensitive data and &quot;shadow&quot; infrastructures (such as dropbox usage) that lead to many recommendations to improve access control and discussions of the value of defense in depth. Second, the specific act of breaking the wifi password allows for a discussion on password security without attacking any specific user's password. Finally, with wireless networks treated as equivalent to wired networks in many offices, reminding the organization that wireless networks extend beyond the physical walls of the office is useful in discussing password rotation and guest network policies.</p>
<p>Once you have access to the network, you need to first document how you managed that and share it with the hosts. This is a great moment to discuss passwords in many cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the organization.</li>
<li>Clarify timing and seek permission with staff - some activities can tax the network or cause disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-14">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Breaking into network requires specialized tools as well as a significant amount of time in capturing authentication packets, and replaying those packets back to the wireless access point.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is a common, but easy to bypass security measure.</p>
<p>WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) has been found with several vulnerabilities. The RC4 algorithm that it uses to generate the keystream for encryption is subject to <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8aeb/2a27abc2a1d0a8b71047606fbeec0f711e03.pdf">two separate weaknesses</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is also found to be vulnerable to attack known as <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/">KRACK</a>(Key Reinstallation Attacks) as well as offline (high speed) attacks against the password itself. WPS, a common &quot;feature&quot; that is on by default on WPA networks, has significant vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/wpa3.html">WPA3</a>, a new standard, is built to disallow offline password attacks, making it significantly harder to break in to that WPA2 networks. As it becomes available and devices support it, it should be a priority upgrade if wifi network security is a concern.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-5">Recommendation</h6>
<p id="recommendations-for-non-wpa-networks">Recommendations for non-WPA networks</p>
<p>Transitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks, is recommended.</p>
<p>MAC filtering and WEP provide no effective protection for a wifi network. Most wifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it should be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do not support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware that supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access. Very few devices still functional do not support WPA2. As WPA3 becomes an option, upgrade to that.</p>
<p id="recommendations-for-wpa-networks">Recommendations for WPA networks</p>
<p>WPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled temporarily to add new devices to the network.</p>
<p>Choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.</p>
<p>The WPA password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains four or five—or more—relatively uncommon words.) The password should not contain common words, including number sequences, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.</p>
<p>A guest network, with no local network access and a distinct (possibly easier to communicate) password should be available if guests are ever given wifi access. Because passwords for guest networks inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the guest password should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.</p>

<h5 id="network-scanning">Network Scanning</h5>
<h6 id="summary-22">Summary</h6>
<p>Network scanning is a technique used to gather information about devices connected on a certain network. It involves enumerating open ports and services running to determine the type of device, the operating system it is running, the applications that is it running and a lot more. There are a lot of open source tools that you can used to perform this technique. Though it may look like simple and ordinary technique, it may be used for both good and bad intentions.</p>
<p>The goal for this exercise is to identify, enumerate and categorize all devices connected to the network. Any device that has an IP address is our target. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop computers</li>
<li>Laptop computers</li>
<li>Tablet devices</li>
<li>Mobile phones</li>
<li>Printers</li>
<li>Wireless routers</li>
<li>VoIP devices</li>
<li>Smart TVs and appliances</li>
<li>Servers and storage devices</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="materials-needed-4">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>Laptop or appliance that can scan the network</li>
<li>nmap/zenmap</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-17">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Scope Devices</strong> Just always remember that some may not want you to scan everything on their network. To avoid this, always ask your auditee if there are specific devices that needs exclusion. These machine can be critical to their operation or they just don't want to get scanned. If your auditee have exclusions, explain the consequences possible if a machine does not undergo vulnerability assessment. If scanning public servers, verify that the server host (web company, cloud provider, etc.) has approved of the scan, and than remote scanning is legal in the jurisdiction you are performing it from and in the location of the remote server.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-15">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Local networks often have a variety of devices connected to them - servers, laptops, printers, and user devices such as cellphones and tablets. Scanning the connected devices can reveal potential areas for further research such as odd ports being open, out of date devices/services, forgotten servers/services etc. These information are then reviewed in vulnerability research exercise, and then (if required) validated in the penetration testing exercise.</p>
<p>Using a network scanning tool (<strong>nmap/zenmap</strong> work well), discover the devices connected to the organization's network, and explore further information such as services, service banners, and operating systems. More intense scans can be too time-consuming to run across the entire network, so target those to higher value systems. As always, be aware of the scans and additional scripts you choose, and focus your exploration (in nmap) on scripts categorized as &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p id="overall-process">Overall Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Using zenmap/nmap, identify all of the devices currently active on the network. It is worth repeating a quick scan at different times of the day and on different days to get a more complete view of the network.
<ul>
<li>Discover network-connected devices, including servers and workstations, but also smartphones, printers, security cameras, voip phones, and other devices.</li>
<li>Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. <a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the active, in-scope devices, the next step is to gather additional details including hostnames, mac addresses (useful for tracking devices over multiple days, as their IP address may change), operating system and versions, port numbers, and any running services such as shared drives, remote management services and old or legacy services. Doing host enumeration sometimes takes time, as not all devices may respond to your scans in the same way. To overcome this, there are variant tools with the steps on how to perform an efficient network scan.
<ul>
<li>Run OS detection options</li>
<li>Scan for open ports and service banners (not all ports correctly map to their &quot;expected&quot; services, also provides service version information)</li>
<li>select additional nmap scripts and more exhaustive port scanning as needed. Filter for safe scripts!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Categorize the devices that you will discover. This is to make it more efficient later when runing vulnerability scans, enabling you to target them effectively. For devices which are not easily categorized, see the IoT section below</p></li>
<li><strong>Port/Service research, and How to decide if an open port is suspicious</strong> If a port is open in a personal computer or mobile device, this should be immediately considered suspicious and investigated.
<ul>
<li>Inspect all systems providing internal services to the host organization.</li>
<li>Identify weak ports or services available under the current device's firewall configuration. <a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>
<li>Identify and investigate any open ports that should not be open (e.g.: almost no ports should be open in personal computers, see below)</li>
<li>Identify all odd/obscure/one-off services. <a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="custom-instructions-per-type-of-device">Custom instructions per type of device</p>
<p><strong>Servers </strong></p>
<p>An open port in a server or IoT device should be investigated if it doesn't correspond to a known service. For example, if the open port is 80, 8080, or 443, it's supposed to be open for a web server, so you can try to browse it by pasting the IP address in your browser address bar.</p>
<p>If it's for SSH (port 22), try to log into it through SSH. If the service isn't supposed to be running in the identified device, you can run a scan of the open ports and request service banners, and/or try to telnet directly to the IP:port to identify what service they are connected to.<br />
To identify what a port might be used for, look at the complete list at <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml">IANA.org</a>. Using nmap's banner scripts will also reveal what the service reports itself as (for example, you can run ssh, usually port 22, on port 443, usually https). Once you have identified what service that port might be used for, always check that that service is actually running in the machine and that the user or sysadmin is aware of it.</p>
<p>In general, these are ports that might be open in a server:</p>

<p><strong>IoT Devices</strong></p>
<p>IoT (Internet of Things) is getting popular in use because of it's ease of use and ability to address certain needs. (e.g. use of IP camera instead of CCTV). As classes of network appliances become common, additional exercises (such as the VOIP assessment) can be created. For others, it is still worth conducting a basic assessment to determine what security implications network-connected devices may have.</p>
<p>In the course of network scanning, watch for devices without clear operating system identification (from nmap/zenmap), and/or devices registering as Linux or unknown (particularly if there are not Linux users or servers), and use hostnames and MAC address lookups <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html">Wireshark</a>, <a href="https://macvendors.com/">MACVendors</a> for &quot;hints&quot;.</p>
<p>Follow up on these devices with more intensive, specific scans to positively identify them, and/or follow up with staff to help physically locate the devices. Some devices, such as Smart TVs, may not even be normally thought of as devices worth considering, but if they are connected to the work network, they can add vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Once any IoT devices have been identified, follow up with research as to their current and possible patch level/software update, what vulnerabilities they may have even if fully updated, and if there have been any known attacks against the platform. Check their configuration to see if they are accessible from the Internet (directly, via UPnP, or via an external service that the device connects out to). Check to see that default passwords have been updated, and any service-connected devices have strong, unique and not-previously-breached passwords.</p>
<p>If there are un-mitigateable vulnerabilities, consider suggesting removing the IoT device from the network or creating a separate network disconnected from organizational resources for non-work devices.</p>
<p><strong>Windows / SMB Networks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SNMP</li>
<li>SMB</li>
<li>NetBIOS</li>
<li>Shared Folders</li>
<li>RDP</li>
<li>Telnet</li>
<li>Password Sniffing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use smbtree to request a list of all smb network device names and nmblookup to connect them to their IP address.</p>
<p>Unsigned NTLM authentication messages vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attack on SMB file servers. It also allow an attacker on the LAN to add, remove or copy files to and from the organization’s file servers (and workstations with filesharing enabled).</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, use netstat from the command prompt as an administrator: the command would be <code>netstat -ab</code> - this will show you the name of the process running on the open port.</li>
<li>To identify the process on the open port more in-depth, run the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Microsoft Process Explorer</a> (right-click a process to see the Properties - the port will be visible in the TCP/IP tab and you will find more information on the path of the process in the &quot;Image&quot; tab).</li>
<li>You can investigate the process on Virustotal directly from Process Explorer, by right-clicking on the process and then clicking &quot;Check VirusTotal&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MacOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Mac, launch <code>netstat lsof</code> - this will show you the path of the process running on the open port.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GNULinux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, follow <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-process-has-open-linux-port/">these instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="external-network-scanning">External Network Scanning</p>
<p>Selected scanning of external network devices (websites, webmail, extranet services) may also reveal vulnerabilities or other areas of concern. However, it is important that you seek approval or any written document that proves you have the authority to scan your target organization along with its web resources and services.</p>
<p>External network scans are different for local network scans. This is because you are scanning devices that are publicly available, and can be done remotely outside the organization's premise. If your auditee agreed to have their public facing machines scanned, keep in mind that you need to consider asking your auditee for whitelisting options for shunning IDS/IPS, firewalls and other blocking mechanisms during your scan. Also make sure that you have verified the target in-scope. This is to avoid scanning out-of-scope targets that may lead you to other problems.</p>
<p>Most of the machines you'll encounter over external network scans were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web servers</li>
<li>DNS servers</li>
<li>Mail servers</li>
<li>Gateway devices</li>
<li>FTP Servers</li>
<li>Cloud servers</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="recommendation-6">Recommendation</h6>
<p>While office networks are often treated as &quot;trusted&quot; spaces, measures should be in place to reduce the potential harm of an attacker who gains access. In addition, devices that &quot;travel&quot; -- such as laptops and mobile phones -- should have adequate security settings (generally, firewalls) to protect them on other networks.</p>
<p>A policy should be in place for connecting personal devices to work networks, as well as work devices to non-work networks.</p>

<h6 id="summary-23">Summary</h6>
<p>Any content that is sent out over the network without encryption is easy to intercept; this includes email, web passwords, and chat messages.</p>
<p>This attacker could be someone, such as a patron of the Internet cafe where a staff member is working, who just happens to be using the same local network to connect to the Internet. Or, she could work for an organization with privileged access to the relevant network, such as the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of either the sender or receiver and other network-backbone connections made along the way.</p>

</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-16">Walkthrough</h6>
<p id="network-traffic-interception">Network Traffic Interception</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The attacker tricks the victim into routing all of their traffic through the attacker’s machine. This involves making a simple request to the victim’s IP address, which is not difficult to do. Computers are rarely configured to ignore such requests.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh -c &#39;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&#39;

$ sudo arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.99 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
<p>Sample Output:</p>
<pre><code>00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
...
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, only a single victim (192.168.1.99) is being targeted, but the attack works fine against multiple victims, or even against the entire network. In other words, the attacker does not need to know which IP address (on the office or Internet cafe LAN, for example) belongs to the target. Furthermore, the victim is extremely unlikely to notice any sign that this phase of the attack is taking place.</p>
<p>EtterCap provides a powerful frontend to managing this process with multiple potential targets. In EtterCap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the &quot;Sniff&quot; menu, select &quot;Unified sniffing&quot; (for most cases where you are using one interface to both intercept and forward traffic), and select the relevant interface (wlan0)</li>
<li>Under the Hosts menu, select the systems on the network you will target, or leave blank to target all systems</li>
<li>Under Mitm, select &quot;arp spoofing&quot; for this example</li>
<li>Select &quot;Start&quot; under the Sniffing menu</li>
</ul>
<!-- Ettercap Screenshot -->
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> At this point, if the attacker is looking for unencrypted traffic, all the attacker needs to do is launch a packet-sniffer, such as Wireshark, and scan through the intercepted traffic for specific vulnerable information, such as email or website logins, as well as traffic revealing shadow infrastructure usage, such as Dropbox.</p>
<p>Wireshark can also be used to identify malicious traffic.</p>
<p>If you rarely use Wireshark, the output you will see will be a long list of packets, protocols and connections that might be hard to classify. To look into suspicious processes in a clearer way, you can use the &quot;Protocol Hierarchy&quot; option in the Statistics menu A good video to learn how to use this option for this purpose can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwQmwbD1uIs">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to practice with captures of malicious traffic, you can find them in the <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures">Wireshark wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Wireshark screenshot -->
<h6 id="recommendation-7">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Only use services with <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication">&quot;SSL&quot; encryption</a> (&quot;HTTPS&quot;), and consider adding <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> to browsers. This does not itself guarantee protection from all attacks, but it is a good first-step in protecting information (such as passwords or email) in transit from your computer to the service provider.</p>

<p id="scenario-1-2">Scenario 1</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>S: Server - a machine accessible globally via ssh. It could be a machine or a virtual server</li>
<li>A: Auditor's GNULinux machine</li>
<li>C: A machine running GNULinux or Mac with ssh on the auditee's end</li>
</ul>
<p>Instruct the auditee to initiate a connection to the server (S) and set up a reverse ssh server:</p>
<p>Let's assume we have a server named safetag-audit.org (S), and usernames for each auditee called auditee1, auditee2, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>on the auditee's machine (C); the auditee will need to be instructed to run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>service sshd start
ssh -R 2200:localhost:22 auditee1@safetag-audit.org</code></pre>
<p>(the auditor has to provide the auditee with a password for the password prompt that will appear when this command is entered.)</p>
<p>this will allow any connection to port 2200 on safetag-audit.org (S) to be sent to port 22 on the auditee's machine (C). The remote port is an arbitrary high number port (&gt; 1023); a practice can be established to assign a number to each location and machine.</p>
<p><strong>example</strong>:</p>
<p>the auditee on machine on site 0 could be instructed to run:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -R 2200:localhost:22 auditee0@safetag-audit.org</code></pre>
<p>this will allow the auditee to connect to port 2200 from within safetag-audit.org (S) and have traffic forwarded to port 22 on the auditee's machine (C).</p>
<p>the auditee on machine on site 1 will run:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -R 2210:localhost:22 auditee1@safetag-audit.org</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: make sure that the ports you use don't conflict with ports by other services or auditees, i.e. don't use a port number twice.</p>
<p>Once this session is open, the auditor can access the auditee's machine (C). At this point there are a few powerful options:</p>
<ul>
<li>simply ssh from S to C via the tunnel (port defined in the reverse tunnel on the server localhost interface);</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example</strong>:</p>
<p>to connect to site 0:</p>
<pre><code>    ssh clientUser@localhost -p 2200</code></pre>
<p>with site 1 in the previous example, the port would be 2210 (or whatever the auditee used in her command).</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a VPN-like connection to site:
<ul>
<li><p>create a forward tunnel from A to S that is &quot;piped&quot; into the reverse tunnel:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -L 2200:localhost:2200 user@safetag-audit.org</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>now you have a tunnel from your localhost:2200 to safetag-audit.org:2200, which in turn has a tunnel from safetag-audit.org:2200 to the client machine on port 22.</p>
<ul>
<li>once you have that, you can use <a href="https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io">sshuttle</a> (needs to be installed, it's in most Linux standard repositories) on the auditor's machine (A) to access additional resources in the auditee's network (as long as they are non-ICMP) directly from the Auditor's machine (A). Such resources might include web-based resources (router web interface for example) or remote desktop (to assess windows or mac clients) or accessing file shares on the auditee's network, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>to do this, you would need to use client credentials through the tunnel you just created, and provide the client subnet to route traffic correctly through that &quot;VPN&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>    sshuttle -r user@localhost:2200 192.168.1.0/24</code></pre>
<p>once this tunnel is created, you should be able to access any resource on the remote network by its IP and port (for example, through the browser for http(s))</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional thing that one might want to do is making the connection from C to S passwordless and automatic (this can be accomplished with tools or scripts readily available on the internet).</p>
<p><strong><em>WARNING</em></strong>: Make sure to remove/clean any persistent connections once you are done with auditing.</p>
<p>There should be no need for multiple reverse tunnels, as multiple forward tunnels can be set up from S to C if needed (eg. VNC or RDP); this requires multiple forward tunnels from A to S though.</p>
<p id="scenario-2-1">Scenario 2</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet through the auditee's LAN network</li>
<li>B: Auditor machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone at the auditee's side will prepare machine A in coordination with the auditor, then install <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/">TeamViewer</a>.</p>
<p>After that, and using a trusted communication method, TeamViewer ID and passcode will be sent to the Auditor.</p>
<p>The auditor will use the ID and passcode to connect to the machine and start using machine A as the auditing machine.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons for this:</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Internet speed: You will need a high speed Internet connection to achieve such task, as the remote access will be transferring the desktop of the targeted machine to you in order to do the tasks.</li>
<li>Connection interruption: While you are working remotely, you might face some connection interruptions during your session, and restarting the remote access will be a challenge because in most of the cases you will need someone at the other end to authorize you to tunnel into the machine.</li>
<li>Physical limitations: You are still physically far from the machine, which means you cannot connect a USB drive to boot from it or do any other tasks that require you to be near the device.</li>
<li>Installing Kali Linux might be hard: It might be hard for a non-technical person to prepare a Kali Linux machine</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usability: TeamViewer is easy to install and use. Anyone with basic knowledge on how to install software can assist you with preparing the auditing machine.</li>
<li>Network speed: Technically, your auditing machine is the machine you are connected to, which is physically located in the targeted office and connected to the LAN network. This means that you will have full speed running your audit tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some remote assistant software provides VPN solutions that turn Machine A into a VPN Server and allow Machine B to VPN into it. Tunneling into that VPN server will allow you to connect to the local LAN network, which will allow you to use Machine B to run the audit.</p>
<p id="using-an-in-the-middle-trusted-vpn-server">Using an in-the-middle trusted VPN server</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A : Auditee's local machine; a clean machine, connected to the Internet through the auditee's LAN network</li>
<li>B: Auditor's machine</li>
<li>C: OpenVPN Server</li>
</ul>
<p>Auditee's Network --------- (A) ---------- C ---------- (B) ---------- Auditor's Network</p>
<p>The auditor will put efforts preparing an OpenVPN server (C) and create 2 profiles (Keys and configurations) to allow machines A and B to connect to C.</p>
<p>Get a VPS from your favorite and trusted VPS provider and keep in mind the physical location of the server, then install OpenVPN Server by following the instructions contained in <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openvpn.html">this guide on Ubuntu Server</a>.</p>
<p>The default configuration of OpenVPN will not allow the clients (A-B) to see each other on the network. To allow that, you have to enable client-to-client directive and enable your both subnets (Auditee and Auditor) to see each others networks. To do so, follow <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/RoutedLans">these instruction</a>.</p>
<p>After finishing the installation and testing it, the auditor will pass the .ovpn file to the person at the auditee's site through a trusted way, and provide instructions on how to install and connect to the server. After connecting A and B to C, the auditor will be able to start the network and device assessment at the other end.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case the VPN is censored in A or B's countries, or in both, you can follow <a href="https://www.pluggabletransports.info/implement/openvpn/">these instructions</a> on how to bypass the censorship by using pluggable transports.</p>

<p>Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides, including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not overlooked.</p>

<h6 id="summary-26">Summary</h6>
<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software running on computers and its current version. The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.</p>
<p>This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-7">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>A notepad may be useful</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-21">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-18">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work &amp; personal). The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what &quot;red flags&quot; they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.</p>
<p>As you work with staff members, also interview them about the other devices they use such as phones and tablets, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, chat Apps, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.</p>

<p><strong>Windows XP</strong></p>
<p>If user is still operating on windows XP, recommendation is to upgrade to later windows.

<p>If there is an organizationally critical system relying on Windows XP, removing it from the network and carefully managing data exchange with it may provide a bridge solution until a replacement process can be funded and rolled out.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-8">Recommendation</h6>
<p><strong>If Unsupported Operating System - Upgrade to Recent Version</strong></p>
<p>Popular operating systems like Windows XP are, sadly, no longer receiving security updates. Upgrade to the latest version keeping in mind the system requirements of the version selected. For Windows, review the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows lifecycle fact sheet</a> for upcoming &quot;EOLs&quot; (End of Life). Apple does not publish EOL schedules, but historically releases security updates for their current and two prior releases.</p>
<p>While &quot;pirated&quot; operating systems and software are extremely common (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security. If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software</p>
<p><strong>If Pirated Software - Move to Licensed Software Systems</strong></p>
<p>While &quot;pirated&quot; operating systems and software are extremely common (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security. If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software</p>
<p><strong>If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software</strong></p>
<p>Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are constantly being updated. These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities. It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.</p>
<p><strong>If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software</strong></p>
<p>Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated. If there are not needed for work by the users, uninstall them</p>
<p><strong>If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and Anti-Maware Scanner</strong></p>
<p>An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and therefore is important to have them installed.</p>
<p><strong>If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus</strong></p>
<p>Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period. An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating of AV is done.</p>
<p><strong>If Unencrypted Drive - Encrypt Hard Drives</strong></p>
<p>When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.</p>
<p><strong>If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)</strong></p>
<p>Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office and public network options. Testing to ensure systems can still perform expected office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless alternatives are created.</p>

<h5 id="password-security-survey">Password Security Survey</h5>
<h6 id="summary-27">Summary</h6>
<p>Weak and &quot;shared&quot; passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; remain the most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-8">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>A prepared Password Survey (given sensitivity and need for anonymity, consider printing and then shredding/burning).</li>
<li>The Level Up Activity, <a href="https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords/activity-discussion/password-reverse-race/">Password Reverse Race</a> provides a staff activity.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-19">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the organization. Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to gather this information. The earlier questions are more important in terms of getting a sense of password practices, so consider adapting or shortening the survey based on staff/leadership buy-in and risk considerations.</p>
<p>How many passwords do you have to remember for accounts and devices used to do your work?</p>

<h6 id="summary-29">Summary</h6>
<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software running on computers and its current version. The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.</p>
<p>This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.</p>

<li>Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-20">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work &amp; personal). The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what &quot;red flags&quot; they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.</p>
<p>As you work with staff members, also interview them about the other devices they use such as phones and tablets, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, chat Apps, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-10">Recommendation</h6>
<p><strong>If Unsupported Operating System - Upgrade to Recent Version</strong></p>
<p>Popular operating systems like Windows XP are, sadly, no longer receiving security updates. Upgrade to the latest version keeping in mind the system requirements of the version selected. For Windows, review the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows lifecycle fact sheet</a> for upcoming &quot;EOLs&quot; (End of Life). Apple does not publish EOL schedules, but historically releases security updates for their current and two prior releases.</p>
<p>While &quot;pirated&quot; operating systems and software are extremely common (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security. If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software</p>
<p><strong>If Pirated Software - Move to Licensed Software Systems</strong></p>
<p>While &quot;pirated&quot; operating systems and software are extremely common (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security. If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software</p>
<p><strong>If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software</strong></p>
<p>Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are constantly being updated. These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities. It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.</p>
<p><strong>If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software</strong></p>
<p>Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated. If there are not needed for work by the users, uninstall them</p>
<p><strong>If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and Anti-Maware Scanner</strong></p>
<p>An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and therefore is important to have them installed.</p>
<p><strong>If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus</strong></p>
<p>Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period. An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating of AV is done.</p>
<p><strong>If Unencrypted Drive - Encrypt Hard Drives</strong></p>
<p>When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.</p>
<p><strong>If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)</strong></p>
<p>Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office and public network options. Testing to ensure systems can still perform expected office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless alternatives are created.</p>

<h6 id="summary-30">Summary</h6>
<p>The auditor checks for the type of mobile devices in the organizations<br />
Follows a series of steps depending on the different mobile devices.</p>
<p>The key considerations with regards to mobile devices are the user, the type of device, and the data it manages.</p>
<ul>
<li>the data is kept secure;</li>
<li>device is configured with the recommended security settings;</li>
<li>the organizational policies and procedures with regards to mobile devices;</li>
<li>In case of organization owned devices, that management has control over its facilitates.</li>
</ul>
<p>These considerations contribute to the development of the report component.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-10">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>A notepad, pen. Also an already prepared list of different kinds of mobile devices</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-24">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Communicate clearly to the staff members the level of access needed for the audit and obtain their consent in case personal devices are being checked i.e. explain that it may involve access of private data on their personal devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: The auditor should not access any personal mobile device absence of the owner of the device and any step taken should be explained before being implemented.</p>
<h6 id="walkthrough-21">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The auditor confirms the number and nature of mobile devices that the organization owns. The auditor should keep within the agreed scope. But in the case where multiple mobile devices outside the agreed scope access the organizations' resources, then redefining of the scope may be necessary. Auditor should also consider the instructions under the device checklist.</p>
<p>As you work with staff members, also remember to interview them about the devices they use. This can alternate between mobile devices and non-mobile devices.</p>
<p>Below are some guiding questions to use. And this is an opportunity for the auditor to go deeper into any area concerning devices.</p>
<p>Guiding questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What categories of mobile devices does the organization have? (eg, laptops, phones, external drives, cameras, recording devices, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>What are they primarily used for?</p></li>
<li><p>What data is stored on the devices and who has access to them</p></li>
<li><p>Are the devices provided by organization or do staff use personal devices for official work? (Auditor: Review the props and cons of each set up)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the risks involved with using each of the mobile devices? (NB: Auditor should know at least 2 risk for each of the devices in use)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the impact of their use to the organization's work?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the organization have specific policies and procedures concerning mobile devices? (eg; policy on use, encryption, location services, access control, password standards, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>If yes; Do the policies and procedures define the access level to organizational devices and also for personal devices?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the policy on using untrusted networks?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the procedures for interacting with mobile systems which are not owned by the organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the existing in/formal security practices for these devices? What are the physical security measures? What are the digital security measures?</p></li>
<li><p>Which mobile phone OS are staff using? What are the props and cons of each?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there someone in-charge of the devices and their security? (NB:Auditor: This checks on the capacity of the organization)</p></li>
<li><p>What applications are installed? (Auditor note: check the device assessment checklist for the technical aspects)</p></li>
<li>What are the users' perception towards the installed applications on their devices? (Auditor: Review the perception vs reality check findings)</li>
<li><p>What security software if any are installed on the devices? Does it offer remote wipe functions?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the users aware of them? (Exam the different categories separately)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the financial implication of maintaining these devices?</p></li>

<h6 id="summary-33">Summary</h6>
<p>Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are thought to be encrypted</p>
<p>Any attacker who obtains a running (including sleeping and hibernating!) Windows, Mac, or even Linux laptop with a Firewire port, an ExpressCard expansion slot, or a Thunderbolt port will be able to read, record or modify any sensitive information on the device, even if the screen is “locked” and the information is stored on an encrypted volume or in an encrypted folder. This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few minutes.</p>
<p>This attack requires physical control of a machine that is not powered off. Full details of the scope of the attack are available at <a href="http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/" class="uri">http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/</a> .</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-11">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>A system with a firewire port, a thunderbolt port, or a PCMCIA slot and a firewire card. See <a href="http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/#Requirements" class="uri">http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/#Requirements</a></li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-24">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are thought to be encrypted</p>
<p>The threat describe in this section is more complex than it needs to be. In fact, unencrypted data are vulnerable to any number of simple attacks, the two most straightforward being: 1) rebooting the computer from a USB stick CD-ROM or DVD containing an alternate operating system, then copying all of the data; or 2) removing the hard drive, inserting it into a different machine, then copying all of the data. These techniques, which work on nearly any computer, even if a strong login password has been set, are effective and widely used, but they require extended physical access to the device. A slightly different attack is described below, one that only requires physical access for a few minutes. It, too, works regardless of login/screen-lock passwords, though only devices with Firewire ports or expansion slots (ExpressCard, CardBus, PCMCIA, etc.) are vulnerable.</p>
<p>The steps required to defend against all of these threats is the same: encrypt your data using a tool like Microsoft’s BitLocker, Apple’s FileVaule or the open-source Truecrypt application. The Firewire attack highlighted here is particularly illustrative, however, because it serves as a reminder that merely setting up an encrypted volume is not enough. In much the same way that a lock does little to protect your home if the door to which it is attached remains open, data encryption is rarely effective while you are logged into your computer. Even if the screen is locked (which would foil the “reboot” and “hard drive removal” attacks described briefly above), an attacker may still find a way to access your sensitive data, while the computer is up and running, because the decryption key is present in the computer’s memory. (This is how large-scale encryption actually works. Information remains encrypted at all times, on the storage device where it lives, but you are able to access it while you are logged in, or while your encrypted volume is “open,” because your computer decrypts and encrypts it on the fly.)<br />
Walkthrough</p>
<p>Step 1: First, the attacker would connect her computer to the victim’s using a Firewire cable. Either or both machines could be using a true Firewire port or a Firewire expansion card. When a Firewire ExpressCard expansion card is inserted, Windows automatically installs and configures the necessary drivers, even if nobody is logged into the laptop.</p>
<p>Step 2: Once connected, the attacker simply runs the Inception tool, selects the operating system of the target machine and waits a minute or two for the attack to complete (depending on the amount of RAM present):</p>
<pre><code>$ incept

<p><em>In the case of the laptops tested, Inception took approximately two minutes to reach the final, somewhat self-congratulatory line shown above. At that point, we were able to login using any password. (Entering “asdf” worked just fine, and gave us full access to all data on the computer.) Inception works by temporarily replacing authentication code using the Firewire’s protocol’s direct memory access (DMA). After a reboot, everything is restored to its original state.</em></p>
<p>Once again, it is worth noting that successful mitigation of this issue requires a combination of technology (data encryption) and some level of behavior change (shutting down laptops at the end of the day, when traveling and at any time when confiscation, theft, loss or tampering are particularly likely.)</p>

<h6 id="summary-34">Summary</h6>
<p>Weak and &quot;shared&quot; passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; remain the most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>

<h6 id="summary-35">Summary</h6>
<p>This exercise supports the auditor in building an effective dictionary that is customized to an organization.</p>
<p>This dictionary can then be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using the examples referenced in the <a href="#wpa-password-cracking">WPA Password Cracking</a> exercise, the auditor can attack weak wifi passwords, which present a non-personal and non-disruptive way to demonstrate password security problems. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</li>
<li>An Auditor can show or discuss their preferred customization strategy and the tools (like JtR) that automatically &quot;mutate&quot; passwords with numbers, capitals, and so on, to demnonstrate the power of a computer to quickly get around common &quot;tricks&quot;</li>
<li>An Auditor can also use a password &quot;survey&quot; to get an understanding of password practices within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="materials-needed-13">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an <strong>already-prepared</strong> dictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required.</li>

<h6 id="operational-security-27">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Inform yourself of relevant local laws</li>
<li>Do not attack individuals at an organization using this, focus on shared passwords (such as wifi)</li>
<li>Always operate with clear consent based in full understanding</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-26">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>This component provides resources and recommendations on cracking passwords - both the creation of dictionaries and rules to modify those dictionaries, as well as some basic implementation as well. This is a dangerous (and in many cases, illegal) skill to use, and should be more of a guide to auditors on what password security myths do not work against modern password cracking software, and to use only with permission and only in very specific situations as a demonstration of the power of even a common laptop against weak passwords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download basic word lists</li>
<li>Research dictionary needs</li>
<li>Create custom word list</li>
<li>Build core list(s)</li>
<li>Attack a password hash using increasingly more time-consuming methods</li>
</ul>
<p>This skillset, plus demonstration against non-invasive accounts, provides an opening for a discussion with staff on password security. See <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/secure-passwords">Level Up</a> for further activities and exercises around passwords.</p>
<p>Primarily for use in the Network Access component, building a password dictionary, understanding the ways to automatically mutate it, and running it against passwords is a useful skill to have, and to use to explain why simple passwords are insecure. This <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/">Ars Technica article</a> provides a good insight into the path to tackle iterative password cracking using a variety of tools to meet different goals.</p>
<p>These instructions use a small set of password cracking tools, but many are possible. If there are tools you are more familiar or comfortable with using, these by no means are required. The only constraints are to be respectful and responsible, as well as keeping focused on the overall goals and not getting bogged down.</p>
<p>A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break most passwords. Using a collection of all English words, all words from the language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>An approach which begins with quick, but often fruitful, attacks to more and more complex (and time consuming) attacks is the most rewarding. However, after an hour or two of password hacking, the in-office time on other activities is more valuable, so admit defeat and move on. See the Recommendations section for talking points around the levels of password cracking that exist in the world. You can work on passwords offline/overnight/post-audit for report completeness.</p>
<p>Here is a suggested path to take with suggested tools to help. You might try the first few steps in both the targeted keyword approach and the dictionary approach before moving on to the more complex mutations towards the end of each path.</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
<li>Begin with a simple combination of organizationally relevant keywords (using hashcat's combinator attack, combining your org keyword list with itself)</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
<li>Language dictionary attack (simple scripting, hashcat)</li>
<li>Run a series of dictionary word attacks:
<ul>
<li>A simple language dictionary attack</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in the org keywords (a full combination creates a massive list, recommend starting with 1:1)</li>
<li>Try other combinations of the dictionary, keywords, years</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brute forcing (do not bother with this on-site)</li>
<li>John's incremental modes, limited by types</li>
<li>Crunch's raw brute-force attack (very, very time intensive - a complete waste of time without GPUs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dictionary Research and Creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before you arrive on-site</strong> it is important to have your password cracking tools downloaded and relevant dictionaries ready to go, as your main demonstration and use of these tools is to gain access to the organization's network. The effectiveness of this demonstration is drastically reduced if you already have had to ask for the password to connect to the Internet and update your dictionaries, tools, or so on. Some of these files (especially larger password dictionaries) can be quite large, so downloading them in-country is not recommended.</p>
<p>Many password dictionary sites, such as <a href="https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords">SkullSecurity</a> , maintain core dictionaries in multiple languages. If your target language is not available, some quick regular expression work can turn spell-check dictionaries (such as those used by <a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center?getCategories=Dictionary">LibreOffice</a> into useful word lists. It is generally useful to always test with English in addition to the target language.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudcracker.com/dictionaries.html">CloudCracker</a> and <a href="http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/">OpenWall</a> have, for a fee, well-tested password dictionaries.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword generation</strong> In addition, create a customized dictionary with words related to the subject as revealed in the Remote Assessment research: organization name, street address, phone number, email domain, wireless network name, etc. For the organization &quot;ExampleOrg , which has its offices at 123 Central St., Federal District, Countryzstan , which does human rights and journalism work and was founded in 1992, some context-based dictionary additions would be:</p>
<pre><code>exampleorg
example
exa
mple
org
123
central
federal
district
countryzstan
human
rights
journo
journalism
1992
92</code></pre>
<p>Also add common password fragments: qwerty, 1234/5/6/7/8, and, based on field experience, four-digit dates back to the year 2001 (plus adding in the founding year of the organization). It's also useful to see what calendar system is in use at your organization's location as some cultures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar#Calendars_in_use">don't use Gregorian years</a>. It's quite amazing how often a recent year will be part of a wifi password -- this presentation discusses many common patterns in passwords: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf" class="uri">https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Optional Further steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use <a href="http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php">CeWL</a> to spider the organization's web properties</strong> to generate additional phrases. This list will need review, as some of the generated content is not very useful, but may be useful if the site is not in a language the auditor reads fluently.</p>
<p>For passwords other than WPA, specific policies or patterns may help to focus your password dictionary further. <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/PACK">PACK, or Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit</a> is a collection of utilities developed to aid in analysis of password lists in order to enhance password cracking through pattern detection of masks, rules, character-sets and other password characteristics. The toolkit generates valid input files for Hashcat family of password crackers.&quot; PACK is most useful for large sets of passwords, where it can detect patterns in already-broken passwords to help build new rules. Both password cracking tools listed here are powerful, and have slightly different abilities. The auditor should choose the one they prefer and/or the one which has the features they desire for this job.</p>
<p><strong>Build more complex password lists with scripting and Hashcat</strong> One quick way to build a more complex password list is to simply double the list up (a &quot;combinator&quot; attack), so that it includes an entry for each pair of these strings:</p>
<p>You can do a 1-way version of this list simply, such as:</p>
<pre><code> $ for foo in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do for bar in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do printf $foo$bar&#39;\n&#39;; done; done &gt; pwdpairs.txt
 $ cat pwdlist.txt &gt;&gt; pwdpairs.txt</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/">Hashcat</a> can do this in a live attack under its &quot;combinator&quot; mode, and hashcat-utils (hiding in /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin) provides this as a standalone tool. This provides a true combination of the list, so it exponentially increases the list size - use with caution, or use with one larger dictionary and one smaller dictionary.</p>
<p>For example, use these combination approach on your custom dictionary (combining it with itself, creating combinations from the above list such as example92, journorights, exampleorgrights).</p>
<pre><code>$  /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin dict.txt dict.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Hashcat is extremely powerful when you have desktop computer systems to use, but has a few wordlist manipulation tools that are useful regardless.</p>

<p><strong>Use word mutation with John the Ripper (JtR)</strong> <a href="https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/commits/bleeding-jumbo">JtR</a> is a powerful tool you can use in combination of existing wordlists, but it also can add in common substitutions (people using zero for the letter &quot;o&quot;). JtR can be used to generate a static list of passwords for other programs, or it can be used directly against a password database. JtR is a bit weak combining words within a wordlist, so you should apply your customizations and any folding before moving on to JtR.</p>
<p>You can add custom &quot;rules&quot; to aid in these substitutions - a base set is included with JtR, but a much more powerful set is added by [KoreLogic] (<a href="http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html" class="uri">http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html</a>). KoreLogic also provides a custom character set &quot;chr file&quot; that takes password frequency data from large collections of <a href="http://www.korelogic.com/tools.html">real-world passwords to speed up JtR's brute force mode</a>. This PDF presentation has a good <a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf">walkthrough of how John and Kore's rules work</a>. <a href="http://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">LinuxConfig</a> Offers another good walkthrough.</p>
<p>The bleeding-edge jumbo version combines both the built-in rules and an optimized version of the <a href="https://github.com/kost/jtr-stuff/tree/master/rules,%20and%20http://openwall.info/wiki/john/rules%20for%20a%20description%20of%20the%20optimizations">KoreLogic<br />
rules</a>. <a href="http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html">This list of KoreLogic<br />
Rules</a> provides nice descriptions of what the KoreLogic rules do. In bleeding-jumbo, you can remove &quot;KoreLogicRules&quot;. <a href="http://backreference.org/2009/10/26/password-recovery-with-john-the-ripper/">BackReference</a> provides a great example of rules usage.</p>
<p>Some particularly useful ones individual rulesets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AppendYears (appends years, from 1900 to 2019) and AppendCurrentYearSpecial (appends 2000-2019 with punctuation)</li>
<li>AddJustNumbers (adds 1-4 digits to the end of everything)</li>
<li>l33t (leet-speek combinations)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some build-in combinations of rulesets - for example, just --rules runs john's internal collection of default rules, and --rules:KoreLogic runs a collection of the KoreLogic rules in a thoughtful order, and --rules:all is useful if you hate life.</p>
<p>e.g. :</p>
<pre><code>  $ john -w:dictionary.txt --rules:AppendYears --stdout</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml">Building custom rules</a></p>
<p><strong>PROTIP</strong> Create a dictionary with just &quot;blah&quot; and run various rules against it to understand how each ruleset or combination works. Note specifically that each rule multiplies the size of the dictionary by the number of permutations it introduces. Running the KoreLogic ruleset combination against a <strong>one word</strong> dictionary creates a list of 6,327,540 permutations on just that word, adding a column output is handy for additional visual impact.</p>
<pre><code>JohnTheRipper/run/john -w=blah.txt --rules:all --stdout |column</code></pre>
<p><strong>Brute force, using John and crunch</strong> JtR's &quot;incremental&quot; mode is essentially an optimized brute force attack, so will take a very long time for anything but the shortest passwords, or passwords where you can limit the search space to a character set: &quot;As of version 1.8.0, pre-defined incremental modes are &quot;ASCII&quot; (all 95 printable ASCII characters), &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (for use on LM hashes), &quot;Alnum&quot; (all 62 alphanumeric characters), &quot;Alpha&quot; (all 52 letters), &quot;LowerNum&quot; (lowercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;UpperNum&quot; (uppercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;LowerSpace&quot; (lowercase letters plus space, for 27 total), &quot;Lower&quot; (lowercase letters), &quot;Upper&quot; (uppercase letters), and &quot;Digits&quot; (digits only). The supplied .chr files include data for lengths up to 13 for all of these modes except for &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (where password portions input to the LM hash halves are assumed to be truncated at length 7) and &quot;Digits&quot; (where the supplied .chr file and pre-defined incremental mode work for lengths up to 20). Some of the many .chr files needed by these pre-defined incremental modes might not be bundled with every version of John the Ripper, being available as a separate download.&quot; (<a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml" class="uri">http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml</a>)</p>
<p>As a last resort, you can try a direct brute force attack overnight or post-audit to fill in details on key strength. Crunch is a very simple but thorough approach. Given enough time it will break a password, but it's not particularly fast, even at simple passwords. You can reduce the scope of this attack (and speed it up) if you have a reason to believe the password is all lower-case, all-numeric, or so on. WPA passwords are a minimum of 8 characters, a maximum of 16, and some wifi routers will accept punctuation, but in practice these are usually just !@#$. — so:</p>
<pre><code>$ /path/to/crunch 8 16 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890$!@#$. | aircrack-ng -a 2 path/to/capture.pcap -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w -</code></pre>
<p>This says to try every possible alpha-numeric combination from 8 to 16 characters. This will take a very, very, very long time.</p>

<p>Note that password cracking systems are rated on the number of password guesses they make per second. Stock laptop computers without high-end graphics cards or any other optimizations can guess 2500 passwords/second. More powerful desktop computers can test over a hundred million each second, and with graphics cards (GPUs) that rises to billions of passwords per second. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking</a>).</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-14">Recommendation</h6>
<p id="recommendation-adopt-stronger-passwords">Recommendation: Adopt Stronger Passwords</p>
<p>Any important password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains five or more relatively uncommon words.) The key should not contain common “phrases,” expecially from well known literature like Shakespeare or religious texts, but also should not include number sequences or phrases, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work, and to use unique passwords for each account.</p>
<p>Because this becomes logistically difficult, <strong>password managers</strong> such as KeePassX or other systems are recommended.</p>
<p>Specifically for <strong>wireless passwords</strong>, choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.</p>
<p>Because shared keys inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the WPA key should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.</p>
<p>As WPA3 becomes more widely adopted, upgrading your network to WPA3 authentication will provide substantial security against wireless password attacks.</p>

<p>Though modern browsers are better at self-updating, and the prevalence of powerful plugins like flash and java are slowly declining, it is valuable to ensure that the browsers in use have updated plugins and are themselves updated.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-14">Materials Needed</h6>

<p>While the threat described below is more severe if carried out by a local attacker (as they can more readily direct the victim to a malicious Web site), it also works remotely. In fact, if a user can be tricked, by a remote attacker, into clicking on a malicious email or Web link, attacks like this represent a significant perimeter threat. By compromising the victim’s machine, they can give the attacker a local point-of-presence without requiring the attacker to crack WPA keys or gain local access in some other way.</p>
<p>Step 1: Using Metasploit, an attacker can easily create an ad hoc malicious Web site:</p>
<pre><code>$ msfconsole

<p>This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network, however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.</p>

<h5 id="vulnerability-scanning">Vulnerability Scanning</h5>
<h6 id="summary-38">Summary</h6>
<p>While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around the office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and unintended information available from &quot;open sources&quot; all pose real threats and deserve significant attention. SAFETAG takes great care to take a very passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns.</p>
<p>This activity uses active research and scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in external and key internal services. Usually penetration tests exploit possible vulnerabilities to confirm their existence. <a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> But, the use of exploits puts the organization's systems at a level of increased risk <a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> that is unacceptable when neither the organization nor the auditor has the time or finances to address the issue. The SAFETAG methodology only uses relatively safe exploitation of vulnerabilities for targeted outcomes. For instance, cracking the wireless access point password allows us to demonstrate the importance of good passwords without singling out any individual's passwords. <a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<li>OpenVAS saves its scan records in /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db - this file will contain sensitive data, ensure it is stored securely.</li>
<li>OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners can be highly aggressive in their tactics. Tools like Metasploit come with a library of active, functional exploits to &quot;prove&quot; that a system is actively vulnerable. As such, these can be tricky to use. Even OpenVAS on a safe-only scan can appear to a host as an active attack, blocking further access from your IP (this can cause some annoyance if you are, for example, scanning your host organization's website from their network). Some of these scans and techniques -- again, even the &quot;safe&quot; ones -- can also be a violation of local hacking laws. Get explicit permission, give warnings, and be careful.</li>

<h5 id="web-vulnerability-assessment">Web Vulnerability Assessment</h5>
<h6 id="summary-39">Summary</h6>
<p>Organizational websites are often a central part of their work, but resource constraints can leave them vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks, from simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to being leveraged for online scams and malicious advertisin to targeted distruction and subversion. Insecure websites can even be used in &quot;watering hole&quot; attacks where malware is implanted into the site to intentionally target the website's audience.</p>
<p>This activity provides a SAFETAG auditor with a suite of processes and tools to investigate organization and project websites for potential vulnerabilities. There are multiple ways to do this, from passive to more active scanning. SAFETAG takes great care to take a primarily passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns. Care should be taken to review operational security concerns, work closely with the organization, and pursue a minimal approach focused on the priorities of the organization. See also the Vulnerability Scanning activity for additional tools and approaches useful for investigating outside of the website itself the server level.</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-31">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Begin with passive techniques and consider if more detail is necessary (e.g. would simply upgrading the CMS solve multiple problems). Remember that the point is to create a clear, simple path towards security, not a comprehensive report on every possible vulnerability</li>
<li>Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - <em>NOTE:</em> The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of &quot;cloud services&quot; used within the organization.</li>
<li>Agree on the site(s) to scan and determine the intensity of the process</li>
<li>Ensure documented permission and schedule an appropriate time with the site host.</li>
<li>In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run &quot;safe&quot; tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the website. Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.</li>
<li>Understand, discover and review the backup options the website has before starting the audit process.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-30">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Performing web vulnerability assessment can be done in different ways, using different tools and having different results. Choosing any of these steps or guides must not confuse an auditor, but instead, provide a broader scope which should help them finding vulnerabilities as many as they can.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities can range from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Server/OS level vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Access control vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Application-specific vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Misconfiguration</li>
<li>SQL Injection</li>
<li>Cross-site Scripting</li>
<li>Directory Traversal</li>
<li>Failure to restrict URL Access</li>
<li>Insufficient Transport Layer Protection</li>
<li>LDAP Injections</li>
<li>Malicious Codes</li>
<li>Leaked information</li>
</ul>
<p>Before pursuing any of these more active scans, review outputs from passive reconnsaisance, DNS history and current information, and (if relevant) CMS version checking. This guide covers a small subset of web vulnerability scanning tools, a more comprehensive list is available at <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools" class="uri">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools</a> which may provide approaches better suited to specific situations.</p>
<p>OpenVAS, covered in the vulnerablity scanning activity, also includes Wapiti, which can help to detect many of the above common vulnerablitites.</p>

<p>Many wireless routers still use the default password listed in <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/">“Router Default Password Search”</a>, meaning that anyone with access to the network could also take complete control of the router - adding in remote access tools or setting up other attacks.</p>

<li><p><em>Framework:</em> <a href="https://github.com/hackatom/routersploit">“Router Exploitation Framwork”</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h6 id="recommendation-16">Recommendation</h6>
<p><strong>Change Default Router Passwords</strong></p>
<p>Passwords - particularly on core network devices - is very important. Use a password manager to save the new password (or be prepared to reset the router to a factory default).</p>
<p>While nominally &quot;inside the firewall&quot; and protected from remote attacks, leaving routers with default passwords, particularly wireless routers whose networks are often shared with visitors, is a potentially very high risk for an organization. Anyone who has gained access to the network via legitimate or other means could subtly alter the router's configuration to provide remote access, or route traffic to an attacker-designated server. Such changes can easily go undetected for long periods of time.</p>
<p>A common fear is forgetting the new router password. A password management system is an obvious solution, but if the router is in a secure location, even a stickie note would be better than the default password.</p>

<p>Sensitive files are often stored across multiple devices with different levels of security. A data assessment allows the auditor to recommend secure storage solutions which best meet the organizations risk assessment and workflow needs. While the auditor has insight on some of this based on the Network Access and Network Mapping work, cross-staff understanding and agreement on what constitutes sensitive data will support later organizational change.</p>
<p>An adversary who obtains a laptop, workstation, or backup drive will be able to read or modify sensitive information on the device, even if that staff member has set a strong account password. This applies to threats involving loss, theft, and confiscation, but also to &quot;checkpoint&quot; scenarios in which they may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a burglary or office raid, an adversary could obtain all sensitive information on the organization's devices, possibly even undetected.</p>

<h5 id="assessing-usage-of-cloud-services-1">Assessing Usage of Cloud Services</h5>
<h6 id="summary-46">Summary</h6>
<p>During the organizational assessment you will almost certainly come across 3rd party cloud-based service providers being used by the audited organization. The organization may be interested in your assessment of the security of those services. This poses several challenges to you as an auditor:</p>
<pre><code>* auditing 3rd party web applications almost certainly falls outside of the scope of the audit engagement
* you likely do not have an agreement with the service provider to scan their application
* a proper assessment would take more time than is available for the organizational audit
* you may not be familiar with the service or technology it is built on</code></pre>
<p>Despite these challenges, significant organizational processes and sensitive data may reside on or rely upon those 3rd party applications. It can be important to the audit to provide some preliminary investigation and risk assessment into the usage of any 3rd party cloud services they rely upon.</p>
<h6 id="operational-security-34">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Auditing 3rd party services <strong>must be negotiated directly with the service provider</strong> and adds significant complexity to the process (and would normally fall out of scope). There are often serious legal issues involved in auditing outside of a formal, signed agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-35">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>It is increasingly difficult to run complex organizations without some reliance on cloud-based service providers such as email hosting, web hosting, or document management/backup. Organizations (and as assisted by the auditor) should review their options in the selection of cloud providers, and in parallel consider ways to apply practices and policies to their use to meet organizational security requirements.</p>
<p id="cloud-service-provider-review">Cloud Service Provider Review</p>
<ul>
<li>In conjunction with Data Mapping, review what data is stored in which cloud service(s), and who (organizationally) has access to that data.</li>
<li>Map out what data and/or metadata the provider has access to</li>
<li>Review the posted Terms of Service and Privacy Policies</li>
<li>Review the transparency report of the provider and what jurisdictions it operates in. Are there local data storage laws in effect?</li>
<li>Does the provider have account protection services meeting the requirements of the organization (e.g. 2FA)</li>
<li>Search for security breaches impacting the service, and review their response (See <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites" class="uri">https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites</a>). Note that a breach itself is not cause to not use a service, but revelations on what was breached and how quickly, transparently, and effectively the provider responded should impact decisions.</li>
<li>Where relevant, review any security/product whitepapers posted on their service and implementation.</li>
<li>Look for any records (and/or request from the company) information about audits of their systems/code</li>
</ul>
<p id="internalorganizational-considerations">Internal/Organizational Considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-up and availability - One of the major risks with an external service is that they will go out of business and/or the data might become inaccessible due to factors outside of the organization's control. Does the provider have guarantees in terms of availability here, and/or what practices can the organization leverage to have additional backup/export options.</li>
<li>Is the organization implementing the best practices put in place by the company offering the service? E.g login processes - 2FA..</li>
<li>What are the password management practices for the cloud/web based services? Account credentials - who opened the accounts and how they are accessible in their absence?</li>
<li>How are logins to the service managed when employees leave or when temporary access is required for a contractor or partner?</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="recommendation-18">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Schedule regular (annual?) reviews of the external services to ensure that they meet organizational requirements for functionality and security, business solvency, and exporting or transferring of data.</p>
<p>When considering formalizing the use of new 3rd party services, review the questions and processes here to help guide the decision.</p>

<p>The organizational security methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world -- how secure are the devices at an organization's office, where and how staff travel with organizational devices, and whether staff work outside of the office (e.g. in remote offices, at their homes, while traveling, or at cafes).

<p>While the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, the physicality of devices, backup drives, servers, and even hard-wired networks cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>For many organizations, digital threats that depend on physical access are considered the least probable. So much so, that many security specialists concede that there is no proper defense against an attacker with physical access to sensitive hardware. While there is some truth to this, it is not useful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media houses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more varied, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to operate.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific threats for each organization, the auditor should consider the challenges of not only one-time exfiltration of data as well as potential ways an adversary could use physical access or proximity to the organization or its devices to gain ongoing remote access, track, or cause harm to the organization through the outright destruction of data.</p>

</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-36">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office. Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components. Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, especially if this is your first interaction -- refrain from this, and if needed, also consider a more &quot;neutral&quot; note-taking process by integrating the Office Mapping activity.</p>
<p>If the auditor is unable to go to the office (or can only visit one of multiple offices), consider having the point of contact use a video call. You will want to have the entire staff be aware of this activity and know the person who is walking around the office. This requires sufficient bandwidth (and unmetered or low-cost) for a 1-hour video call. This could be scheduled for before or after office hours to both discover how devices are left overnight as well as reducing the impact on the network.</p>
<p>Similarly, the in-person tour can also be done outside of normal business hours. Please note: this can damage the trust the staff has in the auditor, as well as unintentionally embarrassing specific staff members in the eyes of the point of contact. It is not recommended to do this except for organizations who have already received training and worked on improving their physical/operational security practices and face an active adversary. This could be before the staff arrives in the morning, during lunch, or after hours (perhaps have dinner with your point of contact, and come back to check the organization afterwards). This gives a clearer picture of how devices are secured outside of the work day (are desktops and laptops unsecured, still on, logged in?). Are backup drives or other storage media easily accessible? Are doors to server rooms/closets locked? Are keys to these locked cabinets/rooms visible?</p>
<h6 id="recommendation-19">Recommendation</h6>
<p><strong>Office Equipment is unsecured against burglary</strong></p>
<p>Unsecured physical network components and devices such as computers, servers, and external drives present a risk of sensitive data loss through theft, seizure, and malicious interference. Access to network compontents and servers should be limited and devices should be secured when not in use.</p>
<p>In the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain sensitive information from devices without encryption, external hard drives, and other easily accessible items. An advanced attacker could compromise the network for later surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Devices</strong></p>
<p><em>Lock in desks or via security cables all easily portable items</em></p>
<p>Any device which connects to the organization's digital assets (and therefore has passwords or cached data) or stores organizational data (including backup drives, laptops, desktops, cameras, other storage media), should be secured (ideally out of sight, such as in a locked cabinet or desk drawer) when not in use to prevent theft and discourage seizure.</p>
<p><em>Follow the Device Assessment guidelines on drive encryption.</em></p>
<p>Encrypted drives offer the best protection against data loss from stolen or seized devices. Follow the recommendations of the Device Assessment section, paying specific attention to the need for strong passwords, automatic locking of logged-in accounts, and the importance of turning a machine off to fully benefit from drive encryption.</p>
<p><em>Place core network components and servers in a locked space.</em></p>
<p>Direct access to servers and network components such as routers, cablemodems, patch panels and switches provides an adversary multiple ways to extract sensitive information and cause extensive, yet hard to detect, damage. Ensuring that not only are these physically protected, but that there are organizational policies around which staff have access to them is critical - a locked cabinet that always has the key in the lock does not provide security. If a particular component needs, for example, regular rebooting, creative solutions should be found to balance security and staff needs.</p>
<p><em>De-activate unused network ports</em></p>
<p>Hard-wired network ports tend to connect directly into the most trusted parts of a network. De-activating any that are in public areas of the office (front desk, conference rooms, break rooms), as well as any that are not needed is recommended.</p>

<h6 id="summary-49">Summary</h6>
<p>This activity helps the auditor assess the organization's current operational security policies and practices through in-person or remote surveys and/or interviews. By also requesting to review and official policies as well as conducting multiple iterations of this with different staff members, some basic verification of the practices and awareness/understanding of existing policies can be achieved</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-18">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>(optional) Survey system with appropriate security precautions and access controls</li>
<li>Note-taking device that can be secured.</li>
<li>For remote support, a secure videochat system (such as Signal) which works with the available bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-37">Operational Security</h6>

<li>It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security. This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-37">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>This activity should build on the preparation work of the auditor, as well as the capacity assessment and context research work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Assessment:</strong> If the auditor has already completed the Capacity Assessment interview, many of the answers from its introductory &quot;Open Up&quot; questions (5-22) provide threat history, likelihood, and some basic policy information, and the questions grouped as &quot;Threat Information,&quot; (58-68) go deeper into previous problems and responses. If those were not asked, they can be included here as a follow-up interview/survey.</li>
<li><strong>Context Research:</strong> Ensure context research has revealed whether the organization would be targeted by adversaries due to their work (e.g. advocacy, engagement in or media coverage of socially sensitive topics, etc.). Threat identification and technical context research should provide insight into likely technical capabilities of adversaries (are malware or other surillance tools used (<a href="https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/" class="uri">https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/</a>) ? Physical surveillance/monitoring? Keyloggers?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an initial interview or survey has taken place (as part of capacity assessment or dedicated to the above-mentioned questions), Send a follow-up request for any policies mentioned or referred to (travel policies, onboarding/offboarding policies for staff changes, personal device usage (&quot;BYOD&quot;) policies, etc.). After reviewing those documents, request any additional policies those may refer to (general IT or security policies), and/or schedule a follow up interview or informal survey to dig deeper into remaining unanswered questions on the operatioal security situation of the organization as well as their adaptations to it. In the (likely) case where there are no policies governing these topics, the auditor can ask their points of contact for these discussions what the general practices are and expand and verify this through additional activities.</p>
<p>In creating new questions, be careful to not &quot;lead&quot; on security in a way that would discourage honest and transparent responses. For example, ask &quot;Do you host community events and trainings?&quot; instead of &quot;Do you allow outside people into your office&quot;?</p>
<p>Below are questions not already covered in the capacity assessment interview process, and after that selected questions from that process which are of particular use here.</p>
<p><strong>Office layout and proximity concerns</strong></p>
<p>Describe your office - is it on a floor of a building? An entire floor? (What level of the building?) How close are other buildings? Is it a shared, open office space or co-working space? (shared network? open access?)?</p>
<p>Has the organization dealt with robberies/theft, break-ins, or office raids? If so, what happened, when, and how did you respond (or do you have a policy or contingency plan? When was that last reviewed/updated?)</p>
<p>What other wifi networks can you see? (See <a href="https://wigle.net/" class="uri">https://wigle.net/</a> )</p>

<h5 id="office-mapping">Office Mapping</h5>
<h6 id="summary-50">Summary</h6>
<p>This activity seeks to identify potential physical vulnerabilities to an organization's information security practices by documenting the current physical layout of the office and the locations of key assets, as well as potential &quot;external&quot; risks such as nearby/shared office spaces.</p>
<p>This can be done in person independently or alongside the &quot;Guided Tour&quot; activity, and can also be done in advance of an assessment or remotely by a willing staff member who knows where these assets are located (often a technical or administrative staff person). This can also be conducted in a multi-office or home-office environment where the auditor is unable to visit every location.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-19">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>Notepad and/or simple drawing or floorplan software</li>
<li>A willing participant (auditor, staff member) who is known to the staff able to walk around and map the office.</li>
<li>A camera (see operational security considerations)</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-38">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.</li>
<li>The location of certain high-value assets is highly sensitive, and may be controlled/secret information. Handle with care when discussing with the organization, and if conducting this remotely/in advance, ensure the point of contact can handle and destroy the data responsibly.</li>
<li>If using drawing software, note that using free online tools could easily leave sensitive data exposed. Offline tools such as LibreOffice Draw, <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn/Downloads.html">Pencil</a>, or even Microsoft Powerpoint or Visio all work, but the product should be securely managed.</li>
<li>Any photos taken (of the map drawing or specific office areas/rooms) should be securely deleted or taken using a secure camera app such as <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/">ObscuraCam</a></li>
<li>It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security. This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-38">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Walk around the office and draw a map of the floor-plan (do not rely upon memory). Consider taking photos of specific areas (e.g. confusing layouts or areas difficult to capture in drawing). Make notes of where intruders could gain access to the office, where sensitive data may live (in the executive director's desk, in a storage closet, on devices), and relevant other items. Also note the overall privacy that the office provides (is it a shared office space, shared building, etc.)</p>
<p>Note the locations of any of the following that apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office rooms and storage:</li>
<li>Meeting rooms</li>
<li>Staff offices/desks</li>
<li>Paper File Storage, such as human resources and financial records storage</li>
<li>Closets</li>
<li>Safe room</li>
<li>Main entry to office</li>
<li>Additional Entry/Exit doors</li>
<li>Windows accessible to the outside (terraces, ground floor, etc.)</li>
<li>Fire escapes</li>
<li><p>Basement/Roof access</p></li>
<li>People (staffing varies widely, adapt as relevant)</li>
<li>Executive Director</li>
<li>Other directors</li>
<li>Financial lead</li>
<li>Human resources lead</li>
<li>Team leads</li>
<li>Office admin</li>
<li>IT staff</li>
<li><p>Additional staff</p></li>
<li>Infrastucture and Devices:</li>
<li>Fuse box / electricity mains</li>
<li>Cable/DSL modem</li>
<li>Router / network switch</li>
<li>wifi access points and &quot;repeaters&quot;</li>
<li>printers/scanners</li>
<li>Paper shredder</li>
<li>Servers (fileserver, email, backup, etc.) and/or desktop/tower computers (which never leave the office)</li>
<li><p>Digital backups (tape drives, hard drives, &quot;time machines&quot; etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If doing this activity remotely and/or in advance of an audit, it may be useful to have multiple staff members independently draw maps and to provide the organization with additional guiding questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you were playing hide and seek, where would be the best place to go?<br />
how they enter /exit, whwere they store stuff (clkosets, etc.)</li>
<li>What is nearby the office? Is it in a shared/open/co-working space? Is it in an office building? A home? An apartment? What floor of the building is the office on? What else is nearby (other offices? Residential buildings, restaurants/cafes)?</li>
<li>If you discovered your office had been broken in to, what would your first guess of where or how the burglar broke in be?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="scavenger-hunt">Scavenger Hunt</h5>
<h6 id="summary-51">Summary</h6>
<p>This activity assists in identifying potential physical security concerns at an organization, particularly when an auditor cannot travel to the office location or cannot visit every office location. The scavenger hunt approach is focused on involving the organization staff members into mapping out potential threats based on the abstraction and the gamification of the physical security mapping process. See the &quot;Risk Hunting&quot; exercise in <a href="https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf">SaferJourno</a>, page 19, for additional ideas and guidance on conducting this activity.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-20">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>(Optional) Mobile phone cameras (see operational security considerations)</li>
<li>Notepad + Pen for each staff member</li>
<li>Printout of example security risks</li>
<li>Encrypted file sharing platform (Signal)</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-39">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Reset credentials found during the process.</li>
<li>Any photos taken (of the map drawing or specific office areas/rooms) should be securely deleted or taken using a secure camera app such as <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/">ObscuraCam</a>. Photos of keys in particular can be used to duplicate a key. The instructions below simply use notepads to track concerns, reducing this risk but possibly being less impactful.</li>
<li>Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.</li>
<li>The location of certain high-value assets is highly sensitive, and may be controlled/secret information. Handle with care when discussing with the organization, and if conducting this remotely/in advance, ensure the point of contact can handle and destroy the data responsibly.</li>
<li>It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security. This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-39">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>The auditor should first meet with the facilitator (possibly over secure videochat) to brief them on the activity and map out potential challenges (particularly around trust, organizational hierarchies, and any potential repercussions).</p>
<p>The auditor then prepares a checklist of physical vulnerabilities with the facilitator, based on the current understanding of the organization's assets and the context they are operating within. The auditor, facilitator, and organization point of contact should decide if any areas are &quot;off limits.&quot; Note that this is only a list of a suggestions. As with the &quot;Risk Hunting&quot; exercise in <a href="https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf">SaferJourno</a>, and it should be modified to fit the requirements, assets, and threats the organization faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open windows.</li>
<li>Door with key hanging from the lock and/or unlocked doors to secure areas</li>
<li>Unlocked access to networking equipment - routers, wifi, modem / cablemodem / servers</li>
<li>Unsecured Laptop(s) (e.g. no locked cabinet for overnight storage, no cable lock)</li>
<li>Computer left unattended with active Outlook, Gmail, Skype or other communication application open and visible.</li>
<li>Wires or cables for devices that have been strewn on the floor where someone would need to step over them.</li>
<li>Portable backup drives, USBs, and/or other external hard drives on desktops or plugged in to computers</li>
<li>Passwords written on a “sticky note” or other paper taped to a monitor or onto the surface of a desk.</li>
<li>Smartphones, cameras or other valuable devices left unattended</li>
</ul>
<p>At the organization, the facilitator explains the activity to the organization members. To balance the need for consent with the benefits of identifying actual daily practices which may need improvement, the staff should already be aware that examining physical devices is part of the audit scope, but not the specific activity. Staff will be able to first identify and address their personal concerns before others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each staff member will get a paper and a pen to note the physical vulnerabilities that they notice (cameras/cellphone cameras can also be used, note the operational security considerations listed).</li>
<li>For each vulnerability noted, the staff member will get a point. The facilitator should encourage staff to also look for other, not listed, vulnerabilities. For vulnerabilities that staff members suggest which were not listed; if they can explain how that vulnerability would realistically be exploited, the facilitator can award a point.</li>
<li>If possible, a prize should be provided to the &quot;winner&quot; with the most points.</li>
<li>Staff must first check their own desks for 5-10 minutes total:
<ul>
<li>Review the physical security of their work space.</li>
<li>Take pictures or notes on their findings</li>
<li>Fix each vulnerability they found</li>
<li>Report back to the facilitator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the entire office space, staff members will spend 15 minutes to:
<ul>
<li>Review the physical security of other desks, meeting rooms, shared spaces etc...</li>
<li>Take pictures or notes on their findings without touching anything</li>
<li>Report back to the facilitator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Debrief:
<ul>
<li>After the &quot;hunt&quot; time is up, the facilitator should gather the staff back together.</li>
<li>The facilitator will gather the notes and review quickly for any high-risk or embarrassing findings. If those exist, the facilitator should privately tell the finder to not bring that up in discussion</li>
<li>The facilitator can lead a discussion on interesting findings, but focus on moving towards changes in practice and policy for the organization to consider.</li>
<li>If possible, quickly calculate scores and announce the winner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reporting:
<ul>
<li>The facilitator should combine the notes and communicate them securely to the Auditor, and securely destroy the notes.</li>
</ul></li>

<h5 id="monitor-open-wireless-traffic-2">Monitor Open Wireless Traffic</h5>
<h6 id="summary-52">Summary</h6>
<p>It can be valuable to to listen to broadcast wireless traffic at the physical office location, even before knowing anything about the organization's network itself. This outside, passive information gathering can reveal a surprising amount of data on not only what devices are connecting to which networks, but also what type of devices they are (based on their unique MAC addresses), and what other networks those devices have historically connected to. These probes can reveal personal, organizational, locational, and device information that, taken in context, can be dangerous or lead to other vulnerabilities.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-21">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>Wifi card (and drivers) that can be set to monitor mode.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-40">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Despite this exercise covering only broadcast data, check the local laws which might cover this process before conducting it.</li>
<li>Consider how it looks to third parties as you are scanning a network, especially from outside an office.</li>
<li>Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the organization.</li>
<li>Delete all devices from your scan that do not belong to the organization.</li>
<li>Study outputs for any obviously embarrassing personal information (especially network beacon records) before sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-40">Walkthrough</h6>
<p id="step-1-monitor-mode">Step 1: Monitor Mode</p>
<p>You should disconnect from any wifi network you may be connected to to capture the widest amount of data.</p>
<p>Switch your wireless adapter to monitor mode**</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng start &lt;interface&gt;</code></p>
<p>You may need to stop your network manager system to prevent it from interfering. Running</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng check</code></p>
<p>to list anything that is causing problems, and</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng check kill</code></p>
<p>to try and stop them automatically, and running stop network-manager &amp;&amp; stop avahi-daemon may keep them from re-starting automatically.</p>
<p id="step-2-listen-for-wifi-probes.">Step 2: Listen for wifi probes.</p>
<p>Run airodump-ng on the monitor mode interface (usually mon0). This listens to wifi beacons and you can begin analyzing who is on what network, and see historical networks.</p>
<p><code>airodump-ng -w filename mon0</code></p>
<p>This scans all networks and channels, collecting broadcast network information. Note that, despite its broadcast nature, this is privacy invasive and can be considered illegal: <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/16/google_street_view_wi_fi_snooping_case_good_news_and_bad_news.html" class="uri">http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/16/google_street_view_wi_fi_snooping_case_good_news_and_bad_news.html</a> . You can restict this to a specific channel or base station ID (BSSID) with -c and --bssid:</p>
<p><code>airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w filename mon0</code></p>
<p id="step-3-de-auth-optional">Step 3: de-auth (optional)</p>
<p>Send de-authentication packets to force clients to reconnect and send out additional probes. Take note that by its very nature, de-authentication causes annoying interruptions to wifi traffic. <strong>This breaks connections, drops skype calls, and can make the wireless network temporarily unusable -- Make sure to check with staff before going through this</strong> (to make sure no one is doing a live webcast or on an important VOIP call, and to expect some network instability).</p>
<pre><code>$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF mon0

 15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on channel 1
 15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]</code></pre>
<p>This command de-authenticates one targeted user with one attempted deauth packet. &quot;-0 10&quot; would try 10 times (potentially disconnecting the user multiple times!). With permission, you can also target all users on a network by leaving out the &quot;-c ...&quot; flag.</p>
<p>There are scripts, like wifijammer, which use this same approach to jam <em>all</em> wifi connections in range of the attacking computer, so check against the documentation at <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org" class="uri">http://www.aircrack-ng.org</a> and act responsibly to protect yourself and the organization.</p>
<p id="step-4-mac-address-research">Step 4: MAC Address Research</p>
<p>The first three hex numbers of each MAC address designate the vendor, which can reveal useful information in matching MAC addresses to devices. The MAC address is a unique identifier, so never post or search using the full address. Note that increasingly, devices are using MAC address randomization, but if it implemented, it often is poorly implemented against even minimally determined adversaries, as per this <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/10/mac_address_randomization/">2017 research study</a>.</p>
<p>To compare found MAC addresses to the bendor database offline you can download the full vendor database from <a href="https://regauth.standards.ieee.org/standards-ra-web/pub/view.html#registries">IEEE</a> or use the <a href="https://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=blob_plain;f=manuf">Wireshark list</a></p>
<p id="step-4-ongoing-monitoring">Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring</p>
<p>The longer you leave this running (particularly when staff are first entering the office or returning after lunch/meetings), the better sense of what devices are connected to the network you will get.</p>
<p>Watch what probes the various devices are sending out (especially when they are deauthenticated, as above). You will see each computer on the network, as identified by their mac addresses, broadcast information about previous networks to which they have connected.</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-23">Recommendation</h6>
<p id="recommendation-cleanse-wifi-network-connection-history">Recommendation: Cleanse wifi network connection history</p>
<p>For most devices, deleting networks from the “saved” network list will stop them from being probed. Obviously, this can be an annoyance for networks you regularly connect to, so renaming these networks to non-revealing names would help, as would creating non-name-associated “guest” networks for colleagues connecting to your home network.</p>
<p>On iPhones and iPads, it is not possible to selectively remove historical networks unless you are currently in range of that network. It is however possible to remove all history: go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings . When you take this step, it is worth going through this reset multiple times – approximately once per year of device ownership, as the first reset appears to only remove recently-connected networks, and older networks will be broadcast.</p>
<p id="recommendation-use-innocuous-network-names">Recommendation: Use innocuous network names</p>
<p>Organizations may want to choose innocent or generic network names, and/or not broadcast network names. It is worth noting that devices seeking out hidden networks will &quot;beacon&quot; for the actual network name, so this has extremely limited security use and must be combined with other protective measures. See this <a href="https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/blog/hidden-ssid-wifi-how-to-know-name-of-network-without-ssid/">Acrylic blog post</a> for further details.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that wifi access points are also tracked to assist in location services, and as such the location of a wireless network can be learned from its name or the MAC address of the access point. <a href="https://wigle.net/">WiGLE</a> is a community-managed database for such information, but both Google and Microsoft, and likely many others, also track this locational information, so the opt-out information below is only minimally useful.</p>

<h6 id="summary-53">Summary</h6>
<p>This component allows the auditor to show the &quot;visibility&quot; of an organization's wireless network to determine how far the organization's wireless network extends beyond a controlled area. Wireless networks are often trusted as equivalent to the hardwired office networks they have largely replaced, but they have important differences. Wireless networks are often &quot;visible&quot; from outside the walls of the office - from common spaces or even the street. Without further access, this reveals a wealth of information about the organization's size and the type of devices connecting to their network.</p>

<li>A portable wireless device (like an Android phone/tablet) is useful to map the network boundaries without causing undue suspicion. Some Apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.webprovider.wifianalyzer">Wifi analyzer</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osiris_mobile.wifimapper&amp;hl=en">Wifi Mapper</a> can help.</li>

<li>Despite this exercise covering only broadcast data, check the local laws which might cover this process before conducting it.</li>
<li>Consider how it looks to third parties as you are scanning a network, especially from outside an office.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-41">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Map the range of the organizations wireless network outside of office space, using wifite or other tools to track network strength.</p>
<p>A variety of apps and tools can support this work without resorting to professional &quot;wifi site survey&quot; tools. If the Office Mapping exercise has taken place, that map can serve as the starting point to expand the map outside the office. If using a third party tool or app, ensure that the app is not sharing sensitive data. Using simple signal strength monitors in combination with location notes is more than sufficient. In Linux systems, one can use wavemon, kismet, wifite, and even the networkmanager command line tools to track visible networks and their strengths <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/237777/is-there-a-tool-like-wifi-analyzer-for-ubuntu">as described on StackExchange</a>:</p>

<h6 id="recommendation-24">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Depending on office layout, moving the wireless access point may help to reduce how far the network is transmitted outside of the office space, and changing devices which do not move to better enable this without loss of functionality.</p>

<p>This component allows an auditor to lead the host organization's staff in a series of activities to identify and prioritize the processes that are critical for the organization to carry out its work. These activities will also reveal the consequences if those critical processes were interrupted or exposed to a malicious actor.

<p>Having the host organization central to the risk assessment process allows the auditor to put their threats and recommendations into the host's own narrative. With greater ownership of the process the staff will be more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. <a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> By engaging as many staff as possible the auditor also is providing a framework for staff to examine future concerns when the auditor is gone. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.</p>

<h6 id="summary-55">Summary</h6>
<p>This activity helps to identify the processes that allow the organization to function (publishing articles, payments, communicating with sources, field work etc) the assets and systems (websites, software, PayPal accounts) they rely on, and which ones are critical to their work.</p>
<p>Participating organization/s are asked to &quot;brain-storm&quot; a list of all the processes that are critical for their work and the auditor works to map the details of critical processes out to expose points of risk.</p>
<p>If done correctly, process mapping can help the auditor<br />
- Identify risk exposure<br />
- Communication issues and effective incident response<br />
- Identify what are affected (people, systems, technologies)<br />
- Identify areas of improvement in securing organization's process<br />
- Generate a mitigation/solution plan for missing security controls<br />
- Show the importance of digital security to staff, management team and stakeholders</p>

<p>This activity contains significant information about the internal process of an organization, and requires proper documentation and secure handling. If this information is leaked, it will expose the organization's process weaknesses. If destroyed without backup, will require you to redo all the steps and activities you have done in the past wasting precious time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat device assessment data as well as any additional service information learned with the utmost security</li>
<li>Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed (throughoughly shredded/burnt papers, and whiteboards/blackbroads erased with alcohol/water) once backed up digitally.</li>
<li>Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure, encrypted, and backed up</li>
<li>Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.</li>
<li>For high-risk organizations, or even among others, it is of best practice to keep digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops and computers turned off during the mapping activity. The use of camera, (not camera phones) is recommended. Mobile devices such as laptops and mobile phones if compromised can record audio, and capture videos.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-42">Walkthrough</h6>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>List all organizational processes:</strong> The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in &quot;brain-storming&quot; a list of all the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work. It is important to remember this is a brainstorming session of all of the processes that occur in the organization. To get started, the auditor may find it useful to give the participants a few examples such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research gathering and source management</li>
<li>Editing / Publishing</li>
<li>Outreach and advocacy</li>
<li>Paying Staff</li>
<li>Managing grants or other funding</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Determine critical processes:</strong> During this exercise the aim is for the auditor to lead the attendees in narrowing down the subset of activities to those that are crucial to their work. Once the participants have brainstormed these out the facilitator leads the participants in identifying critical processes (this may be all of the processes identified).
<ul>
<li>Quickly identify the main purpose of the organization.</li>
<li>Once a complete list has been created, the auditor will then go through through to identify with the participants the critical processes within the organization – that is, without these processes the organization would not be able to function or function at a very poor level, or would not fulfill its mission</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> If an auditor does not ensure that the uniquely identified subset of processes speaks to the full range of participants, their recommendations are more likely to be met with resistance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map out critical processes:</strong> In this exercises the auditor does free-hand drawing (ideally on a whiteboard to allow for easy changes) mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The auditor needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.
<ul>
<li>Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart</li>
<li>Have your participants explain to you what the process is step-by-step, while making a note on the side where there will be follow on processes.</li>
<li>Keep it simple to facilitate broad understanding of the OVERALL process. Too much detail early on can be overwhelming and/or lead to confusion. If you agree that more detail is required on a particular action, it is easy to highlight that box and produce a separate chart showing the process taking place within.</li>
<li>Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity.</li>
<li>Keep track of participant engagement and reactions in case there are edge cases you may need to follow up on individually afterwards.</li>
<li>After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While doing this it is important to consider level of detail you will be mapping out (this should be pre-determined or established so everyone is on the same page). You will generally want to capture:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people involved;</li>
<li>The tasks, conversations, and decisions they carry out;</li>
<li>The flow of materials, information and documents between them;</li>
<li>How the actions take place (email, calls, travel)</li>
<li>The relationship and dependance between the steps.</li>
<li><p>Actual processes, not idealized ones</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identify points of failure:</strong> Begin to ask questions of how or why a particular process or step could be problematic or risky. Depending on the organization, you may want to do this as only mental notes to yourself or as a more interactive discussion. The goal is to improve the organization's understanding of their own processes and the risks they include.</p></li>
</ul>
<h6 id="recommendation-25">Recommendation</h6>
<p>Process mapping is simply documenting the steps in a certain process or simply an inventory of why you do the things that you do. It is your job as an auditor to map the organization's existing process in order to achieve sound judgement in providing digital security recommendation or solution.</p>
<p>This activity can sometimes lead to hopelessness, or challenge; it is important to remind the staff that any risk can be mitigated, and indeed it is the goal of an audit to identify the highest priority ones based on actual likelihood and provide guidance on mitigation.</p>

<h5 id="self-doxing">Self Doxing</h5>
<h6 id="summary-57">Summary</h6>
<p>Doxing (also &quot;doxxing&quot;, or &quot;d0xing&quot;, a word derived from &quot;documents&quot;, or &quot;docs&quot;) consists in tracing and gathering information about someone using sources that are freely available on the internet (called OSINT, or Open Source INTelligence).</p>
<p>Doxing is premised on the idea that &quot;The more you know about your target, the easier it will be to find their flaws”. A malicious actor may use this method to identify valuable information about their target. Once they have found sensitive information, they may publish this information for defamation, blackmail the target person, or use it for other goals.</p>
<p>This activity aims to help participants identify any unwanted personal information that may be publicly available online, and to make them aware of the risk of doxing and how to prevent it.</p>

</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-44">Walkthrough</h6>
<ul>
<li>Prepare before the activity by doing this research on a few members of the organization to identify good examples</li>
<li><p>Present the problem to the group:</p>
<p>Harassers and stalkers use several tools and techniques to gather information about their targets, but since these tools and techniques are mostly public and easy to use, we can also use them ourselves, on ourselves, as a preventative measure. &quot;Self-doxing&quot; can help us make informed decisions about what we share online, and how. (Of course, these same instruments can also be used to learn more than is immediately obvious about someone we have met online before we give them our full trust - for example to decide if we want to admit them to a private mailing list or group on social networking platforms.)<br />
Methods used for doxing (and self-doxing!) include exploring archives, yellow pages, phone directories and other publicly available information; querying common search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo; looking for a person's profile in specific services; searching for information in public forums and mailing lists; or looking for images that the person has shared (and for instance may have also published in another, more personal, account). But it can also simply consist in looking up the public information on the owner of a website, through a simple &quot;whois search&quot;.</p></li>
<li>Ask the group to brainstorm possible search engines and websites where information could be found on them and their communities - encourage them to think of local services or services used by their friends, including social networking platforms.</li>
<li>Give out copies of this <a href="https://guides.accessnow.org/self-doxing/self-doxing.html">self-doxing guide</a></li>
<li>While projecting to the group, conduct a research on yourself or a high-profile member of the organization who has given their consent. Perform the search on websites mentioned in the self-doxing guide and during the brainstorming activity.</li>
<li><p>Either have them do the same research on themselves in pairs or assign this research as homework.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If participants perform the research at home, it is important to warn the group that when practicing self-doxing, there is a risk of getting exposed to results that they may find disturbing. Tell them that if they think they may need support, they should ask a close friend to be around while they carry out their research.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instruct participants to use the Tor Browser and a browser different than their usual one to perform the research, and ask them to search both on the websites and services listed in the self-doxing guide and in the ones mentioned during the brainstorming.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that, to decide what to search for, one should try to understand what activities expose them to a higher risk of being attacked by trolls or other malicious actors. They should ask themselves: &quot;Why would someone want to spend hours of their time to track information on you in the internet?&quot; Add that this kind of attack often affects minorities or people who support controversial opinions online, and the attack starts from the information that the malicious actor will find immediately available - like the nickname and profile used by the target in the platform where the attack has started, or the pictures the target has published in their page. This is where they should start from.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct the group to check the properties of the posts and media they have published, to make sure that they aren't leaking their IP address or other metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>Show the group a reverse image search on <a href="https://tineye.com/">TinEyE</a> or Google and recommend they do it on pictures of themselves they have published online.</p></li>
<li><p>Show the group how to check if their online account has been previously compromised on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a>. Explain that often results are old and if they have changed their password recently, showing up on this search may not be a problem. Tell them that if they are still using that old password for the compromised account of for other accounts, they should immediately change that password.</p></li>

<p><strong>Due to the limited window of time, the auditor should focus on identifying suspicious activities and triaging them rapidly</strong>. Many of these will be false positives related to other non-malicious software causing the machine to &quot;act weird&quot; or other types of less serious (and non-targeted) malicious software like adware or ransomware.</p>
<p>When this cannot be ruled out, collecting evidence, running basic research and analysis, and assessing the risk and impact against organizational priorities will help prioritize further action. In-depth binary analysis is best kept for post-audit work during the reporting and follow-up phases. If critical assets are compromised, the auditor might need to coordinate urgent mitigation measures with other IT experts.</p>
<p>Time management is extremely crucial when responding to potential malware infections and similar more advanced threats. If using this method, the auditor should constantly question whether to continue this process or complete other aspects of their audit plan. At the end of the audit process, not having an understanding of the organization's risk tolerance, existing capacity, current practices/processes/policies and existing informational assets will undermine the auditor's ability to provide a prioritized report or understand the context around the potentially malicious activity they have uncovered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adversary Capability Assessment</strong> - This should be an output from the technical context research work. Are there Advanced Persistent Threats which should be taken into account? How do they operate? Are there known indicators of compromise to look for?</li>
<li><strong>Analyzing Specific Suspicious Events/Activities</strong> - If the organization have specific concerns or evidence suggesting a targeted attack, the auditor can focus attention to match them against any known attacks or flag them for further research.</li>
<li><strong>Looking for Indicators of Compromise and Threat Hunting</strong> - If the organization suspect that they have been compromised, but do not have any specific, suspicious device/process/email, the auditor can leverage techniques to intelligently spend their time to investigate further.</li>
<li><strong>Capture Evidence for later Analysis</strong> - If suspicious activities are identified, the auditor may want to capture evidence to analyze or share with professionals. This is time-consuming and the captured evidence is high-risk, so be extremely careful in pursuing this.</li>
<li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong> - If malware is discovered, but cannot be identified, further analysis will be necessary. This may also trigger a change in assessment scope and/or an incident response approach.</li>

<h5 id="suspicious-activity-analysis">Suspicious Activity Analysis</h5>
<h6 id="summary-59">Summary</h6>
<p>Malware is a common tactic to target organizations. Malware like a Remote Access Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a targeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and video, as well as run commands on the infected machine.</p>
<p>To stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel spending time on stopping the malicious process.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing such issues.</p>
<p>Scanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.</p>
<p>After determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.</p>
<p>In case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited. Also see operational security considerations that come with replicating the files of a staff member of a sensitive organization. Be sure this is absolutely necessary and the staff members provides consent before completing.</p>

<h6 id="summary-60">Summary</h6>
<p>This component briefs the tools and procedures required to acquire the image (live or dead, depending on the situation) and securely handle data from a device (laptop, desktop, HDD, memory stick, USB stick, etc.) that is needed to later perform a malware analysis or forensic evidence process.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-27">Materials Needed</h6>
<p><strong>Skills Needed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use of evidence capture tools (below) to capture memory dumps and to byte-copy the data in order to create a forensic image to be used to execute tests without affecting the original evidence received.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Required software</strong> - depending on the data acquisition type and the operating system, you will need the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live imaging:</li>
<li>Windows: DumpIt</li>
<li>Mac OS: OSXpmem</li>
<li>Linux: LiME - Linux Memory Extractor</li>
<li>Dead imaging:</li>
<li>DEFT distro</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional materials</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labels or tags</li>
<li>anti-static bags</li>
<li>equally sized or larger hard drive or storage device to store the image</li>
<li>USB stick to collect a file log</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-48">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>Define how to handle the documentation and containment related to the data acquisition.</li>
<li>Follow the data forensic analysis procedures that are required to ensure the evidence is properly handled (see &quot;Important notes on capturing evidence for analysis&quot; below).</li>
<li>Document all the process and keep a log, including timestamps, dates, and time zones, as well as versions of software and operating system.</li>
<li>Carefully consider how to protect this data in transit to analysis. See &quot;How to handle forensic data&quot; below for notes on the Chain of Custody.</li>
<li>While byte-copying data, be extremely careful when typing the command line <code>dd</code> or related. Reversing the <strong><code>if</code></strong> and <strong><code>of</code></strong> flags, or confusing the label of the device block related to the source or destination device <strong>will cause the computer to destroy the evidence!</strong></li>
<li>If possible, always connect the source disk with a write blocker to prevent modification of the evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Chain of Custody: How to handle forensic data</strong></p>
<p>The Chain of Custody (often referred to as audit trail or chain of evidence) is the process of preserving the integrity of the digital evidence. Being able to maintain the Chain of Custody is very important for forensic evidence. This means that you need to record, and be able to prove, that authorized personnel were in control of the evidence at all times, and that no unauthorized person or device or mechanism could have altered the evidence while in our custody.</p>
<p>To maintain the Chain of Custody, it is imperative to carefully document what happens to the evidence. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Store the evidence in an anti-static bag</strong>, or similar appropriate container that will protect the device from static electricity or other destructive forces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clearly label the evidence.</strong> There must be no confusion about a piece of evidence. All evidence, whether hard drives, USB sticks, DVDs, etc. should be clearly labeled with the following information:</p></li>
<li>What the evidence relates to</li>
<li>Who received the evidence</li>
<li>Location of where the evidence was received</li>
<li>Location of where the evidence was sourced from</li>
<li>The date and time the evidence came into our possession</li>
<li><p>Any other notes you think are relevant regarding this piece of evidence (the specifications of the computer a hard drive came from, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Every time the evidence changes hands, <strong>the next person responsible for the evidence should &quot;sign for it&quot;</strong>, which means documentation should be produced where the recipient of the evidence confirms they have received the evidence into their custody with their signature.</p></li>
<li><strong>Deny unauthorized personnel from accessing the data</strong> - Every reasonable effort must be taken to prevent unauthorized access to the stored evidence. This means:</li>
<li>Storing the evidence in a locked safe</li>
<li>Controlling access to areas where the evidence is stored and analyzed</li>
<li><p>Not leaving unauthorized people alone with the evidence</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you have to send evidence via courier, or the postal service</strong>:</p></li>
<li>Special containers should be used to seal the evidence in such a way that the container cannot be opened without it being apparent (e.g. seal with special tape that, if removed, cannot be replaced without showing that the container has been opened).</li>
<li><p>Make a copy (image) of the evidence before sending the original through the post or courier service, and generate a hash of the image.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Live or Dead Imaging?</strong></p>
<p>Different processes and tools are used depending on what kind of data acquisition and investigation will be done. However, in order to make a correct decision on how to get the forensic image, you should take into account the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the computer networked? The data in a networked device could be remotely erased. That's why this question is relevant and time sensitive.</li>
<li>Is the computer running? Important volatile information could be lost if the computer is turned off.</li>
<li>Do you want to preserve volatile data? Nowadays, sophisticated malware hides on volatile data and modern web browsers can operate in ‘incognito’ or ‘private’ mode (no information is saved). In most of these cases, preserving live evidence is the only way to go, so deleting it may cause loss of evidence. Therefore this decision should be taken in advance, based on the details gathered before the data acquisition.</li>
<li>Is full-disk encryption enabled? An encrypted disk could complicate the investigation. If the disk is encrypted, the investigator should ask for the password and decrypt the disk manually.</li>
<li>Is the console unlocked? if the console is locked, a live CD should be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the definitions, we call 'dead imaging', or 'offline imaging', the process of obtaining evidence from systems that are switched off and where no data processing is taking place, while 'live imaging', or 'memory imaging', refers to the process of making a bit-by-bit copy of memory in order to preserve the volatile data available in the device. There is a lot of information of evidentiary value that could be found in a live system. Switching it off may cause loss of volatile data such as running processes, network connections and mounted file systems. On the other hand, leaving a computer running may cause evidence to be altered or deleted. Therefore the investigator needs to decide what alternative is best in each given situation. Another approach is to use specialized tools to extract volatile data from the computer before shutting it down.</p>

<h6 id="summary-61">Summary</h6>
<p>This component describes how to perform an analysis on captured evidence (e.g. hard drive image or memory dump) without altering the evidence. Any alteration, or even an environment or situation that creates the possibility of alteration, could lead to rejection of the evidence in a court of law or to malware analysis failures.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-28">Materials Needed</h6>
<ul>
<li>Existing skillset and experience analyzing digital forensic evidence or trusted contacts who can help</li>
<li>External storage devices to store backup copies</li>
<li>Notepad or way to log your work</li>
<li>Forensic analysis software (e.g. Sleuth Kit, Volatility)</li>
<li>Dedicated system or setup for analysis</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="operational-security-49">Operational Security</h6>
<ul>
<li>If you have not analyzed malware before, do not start with real, live, and potentially targeted malware. See the References section from the Advanced Threat method for opportunities to build your skills without putting the organization or yourself at additional risk.</li>
<li>Any analysis must be done with extreme caution (using a dedicated system, carefully managed VM, with very limited/monitored if any network access)</li>
<li>Continue to follow the Chain of Custody procedures described in the Evidence Capture activity</li>
<li>Follow the procedures for logging and hashing described in the walkthrough</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-47">Walkthrough</h6>
<p><em>In most cases, reach out for help, there are multiple organizations which coordinate and can support malware analysis targeting NGOs. The <a href="https://rarenet.github.io/DFAK/en/SecureCommunication/">Digital First Aid Kit</a> has a list of organizations and in most cases secure contact details to seek support in doing advanced analysis. The <a href="http://www.rarenet.org/">Rapid Response Network</a>, a project of <a href="https://civicert.org/">CiviCERT</a> is a consortia of these organizations who may be able to help. <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a> is also well known for their analysis and research.</em></p>
<p>There are some procedures that must be followed to ensure the evidence is properly handled while the forensic analysis is taking place. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep a log of everything you do to analyze the data.</strong>
<ul>
<li>What you connected it to, and how</li>
<li>Each and every command you ran against the data image as you perform your investigation</li>
<li>This log must identify who is performing the analysis</li>
<li>Date and time stamps for each action performed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Only work on copies of the data, not the source data.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ideally make multiple copies</strong> from the initial copy, as you may need to work on fresh copies if your analysis accidentally modifies the copy you are working on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediately on receipt of the source data, make a cryptographic hash of that image, and store it in a safe place.</strong> This is your <em>only</em> guarantee that you have not tampered with the evidence you are working on!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After making a copy of the data, immediately create a cryptographic hash of that image</strong>, and check it against your master hash to ensure they match.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As you work on your investigation on a copy of the data, periodically check that data image with the cryptographic hash</strong>, to ensure you have not inadvertently modified the data by performing your investigation. If the hash does not match, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the fact that the hash no longer matches in your activity log.</li>
<li>Look in your log at all the steps you have taken between when you last checked the hash and now. One or more of the steps you have taken has modified the data of the copy, so you need to work out which step caused this, and how to perform a copy in the investigative step without modifying the data.</li>
<li>Abandon the now modified copy of the data. This is tainted, so clearly mark it as such and return it to secure storage.</li>
<li>Use a fresh copy of the data, again checking the hash to ensure it is clean before proceeding with the investigation.</li>
<li>If necessary, make extra copies of the data from the original source image you created (making sure to never perform investigative steps on that source image).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to facilitate the data analysis, we recommend to get the output data from the image acquisition in raw/dd format, which is accepted as input file in several forensic analysis tools.</p>
<p>To analyze the acquired data, you can use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/index.php">Sleuth Kit</a> is a kit of useful open source digital forensic tools to analyze the acquired data. Available tools in this kit include command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images and recover files from them, and a GUI-based program (Autopsy) that allows you to efficiently analyze hard drives and smartphones. Both tools can be found in the DEFT distro (The Sleuthkit 4.1.3), along with another useful tool kit (Digital Forensics Framework 1.3).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/releases">Volatility</a> is an open source framework used for volatile memory forensics or RAM forensics for images taken in Linux, MacOS and Windows. More info and tutorials can be found <a href="https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h6 id="recommendation-28">Recommendation</h6>
<p>If any indicators of compromise are found, using the Suspicious Activity Analysis approach to do very initial research/analysis and triage (are these known malware or adware IoCs, etc.), and adjusting your reporting and operational security procedures with the organization as appropriate.</p>

<p>Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current threats will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations. With greater ownership of the process the staff provides an opportunity to explore their threat landscape and become more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. By engaging with as many staff as possible the auditor is providing a framework for staff to explore threat identification processes when the auditor is gone.</p>

<h5 id="threat-identification">Threat Identification</h5>
<h6 id="summary-63">Summary</h6>
<p>These activities build off of a process or data mapping exercise to connect actual processes or assets and data of the organization with potential threats, then drilling down into specific, likely threats the organization faces, adversaries who might take advantage of them, and the impact of this happening.</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>Threat History</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What history of attacks does the threat actor have?</li>
<li>What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>What is known about the types of threats used by an threat actor to attack similar organizations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Capability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to exploit a vulnerability that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against all similar organizations, or will they have to prioritize their targets?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Intent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have they targeted similar organizations?</li>
<li>Does the threat actor currently have the desire to conduct an attack against this type of organization?</li>
<li>Is the organization a priority threat target for the threat actor?</li>

<h6 id="walkthrough-48">Walkthrough</h6>
<ul>
<li>Requires a process or data mapping exercise's outputs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Identification (30 minutes per process):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give participants a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of threats.</li>
<li>Explain the types of threats.
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process exists.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: If an asset/process is changed without permission.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: If an asset/process becomes unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: If an asset/process becomes unreliable. (Some use <strong>Identity</strong> instead or in addition to Consistency, if an asset/process can be spoofed to appear as owning/coming from someone else.)</li>
<li><strong>Auditability</strong>: If you cannot verify that an asset/process is secure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify a &quot;interaction line&quot; from the process map to start with.</li>
<li>Generate a list of threats that would cause that interaction to fail.</li>
<li>Mark the back of the post-it with the interaction name or number.</li>
<li>Write the threat and their impact on post-its and arrange them in an orderly way.</li>
<li>If multiple risks cause the same consequence create a new post-it near the new risk.</li>
<li>Continue doing this for all the interactions in the critical process'.</li>
<li>Discuss and rearrange threats as groupings emerge.</li>
<li><p>Label threat clusters that appear.</p></li>
<li>**<a href="NOTES:**" class="uri">NOTES:**</a>
<ul>
<li>If any of the impacts identified in the pre-mortum or other process-mapping exercises are not covered ask participants where they would go.</li>
<li>Take photos of the threats once you have finished enumerating them.</li>
<li>Write risks on one set of post-its and impacts on another color of post-its to make it easy to keep track.</li>
<li>Look at the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0">&quot;CVSS v3 Base Metrics&quot;</a> for an example of the severity of different threats.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact Identification (30 minutes per process):</strong> This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences (impacts) when the threats identified earlier occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give participants a pen and three sticky note pads.</li>
<li>Explain the topic and the categories. <a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>Staff/People - (which includes families, friends, and beneficiaries): temporary or permanent<br />
physical injury, temporary or longer-term psychological damage, death, legal costs, cost of medical treatment, loss of morale or trust in management.</li>
<li>Organization - loss of or damage to assets, operational inefficiency, loss of program quality or outright suspension; loss of reputation; loss of funding.</li>
<li>Program - reduced program quality, temporary suspension of the program, forced termination of the program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instruct each person to generate DIRECT impacts based upon the exiting threat clustering from <strong>Threat Identification.</strong></li>
<li>Include only one impact per sticky note.</li>
<li>Have one participant quickly describe then place an impact on the board writing along side it the threat that causes it.</li>
<li>Invite others to place similar/the same impacts in proximity and quickly describe how it can occurs.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until all impacts are included.</li>
<li>Have participants add stickies for any secondary/cascading impacts</li>
<li>Discuss and rearrange impacts as groupings emerge.</li>
<li><p>Label impact clusters that appear.</p></li>
<li>**<a href="NOTES:**" class="uri">NOTES:**</a>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adversary Exploration (Likelyhood):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the topic and the categories. <a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>&quot;History – a past incidence or pattern of attacks on similar organizations.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Intent – specific threats, a demonstrated intention or mindset to attack.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Capability – the wherewithal to carry out an attack.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brainstorm adversaries who have demonstrated likelihood to impact their work or one of the process'.</li>
<li>Pick an adversary and write their name on the board.</li>
<li>Write specific instances of adversary history, intent, and capacity announced by the participants.</li>
<li><p>Repeat the process until all adversaries are completed.</p></li>
<li>**<a href="NOTES:**" class="uri">NOTES:**</a>
<ul>
<li>Limit the time frame for discussion.</li>
<li>Take photos of the adversary lists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact Ranking:</strong> The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible impacts from the threats they have just explored.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a post-it for each impact.</li>
<li>Place two points on the wall. On one side are &quot;Inconvenient&quot; impacts that disrupt the organization in a very small way. On the other side are &quot;critical&quot; impacts that may pose life-safety risks to employees, partners, or the general public.</li>
<li>The low end of the scale may include a fire alarm may cause the staff to lose a half an hour of work time, but does not impact any short or long-term activities.</li>
<li>The high end of the scale would include events such as a fire that destroys the organizations headquarters and endangers staffs lives or legal issues that cause termination of the program.</li>
<li>Place each item along the severity line from least to most severe impact.</li>
<li><p>Give each item its own place on the scale. No two items can be the same severity.</p></li>
<li>**<a href="NOTES:**" class="uri">NOTES:**</a>
<ul>
<li>Listen carefully to every point of deliberation.</li>
<li>As risks are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked risks to help participants identify the right place. &quot;Is a robbery more or less likely than a fire?&quot;</li>
<li>Take photos of the impact scale once you have finished it.</li>

<h5 id="threat-interaction">Threat Interaction</h5>
<h6 id="summary-64">Summary</h6>
<p>This helps the auditor enumerate threats that the organization is concerned about and the internal priorities of them. At the same time, it enables a discussion of how threats can interrelate and helps define the difference between a threat and a risk (a threat that has a vulnerability associated with it), and the value of mitigation.</p>
<p>This exercise works well with larger groups, and can be woven in to the Threat Identification activity.</p>
<h6 id="materials-needed-31">Materials Needed</h6>

</ul>
<h6 id="walkthrough-50">Walkthrough</h6>
<p>Also review the Threat Identification exercises below to tailor these to best meet your information gathering needs based on your interactions with the organization.</p>
<p id="threat-brainstorming-15-minutes">Threat Brainstorming (15 minutes)</p>
<p>Split participants into small groups. This grouping is particularly valuable for larger organizations, but even for small ones, having multiple separate groups helps reveal shared concerns around the threats the staff face. For a group that is too small to group, have each staff member brainstorm by themselves.</p>
<p>Have each group or staff member quickly write down any possible &quot;threat&quot; they or the organization face. Some examples (&quot;kidnapping,&quot; &quot;website hacked&quot;) can help seed this activity.</p>
<p>If you have multiple colors of stickies, having them categorize threats by &quot;physical,&quot; &quot;digital,&quot; or &quot;other/both&quot; will be useful to show their inter-relation.</p>
<p>Keep reminding participants of the time remaining to keep them brainstorming rather than discussing threat details or arguing over whether a threat is physical or digital.</p>
<p id="threat-clustering-and-discussion">Threat Clustering and Discussion</p>
<p>After the brainstorming (or other exercises to generate or present a list of concerns), gather and cluster the stickies on a wall, revealing duplicate concerns across the groups and thematic areas of concern.</p>
<p>As clusters become clear, ask if any events similar to this threat have already happened to the organization? What was the impact? Has it happened more than once? Regularly? Mark these threats.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Some of these threats may be traumatic experiences, consider skipping public discussion of historical occurrence if many of the threats from the brainstorm (or from one person/group in particular) are particularly intense.</p>
<p id="threat-bow-tie">Threat Bow-tie</p>
<p>Select one of the threats that emerged as a concern from the clustering to place at the center of a &quot;bow-tie&quot; like drawing on a whiteboard or flip-chart paper.</p>
<p>Begin asking what other threats identified could come as a result of this threat, supplanting the responses from the participants with additional threats. For example, a hacked website could lead to loss of trust by funders or partners. &quot;Chain reactions&quot; can be illustrated as lines of events (loss of trust by funders could lead to a loss of funding). Do the same for what threats could lead to the &quot;central&quot; threat - a confiscation of a device could lead to email hacking, for example. Some threats can be both potential causes and secondary effects.</p>
<p>Close out this with a discussion of how every threat is potentially connected to both digital and physical impacts.</p>
<p id="threat-analysis-worksheet">Threat Analysis Worksheet</p>
<p>The auditor should be able to modify and complete a worksheet like the below at the end of this process. Particularly advanced organizations may be able to fill this out as a survey.</p>

<p>SAFETAG is an auditing framework designed to connect small civil society organizations and independent media outlets to the digital security services they need. But, more than that it is designed to provide audits that increase an organization's agency to seek out and address security challenges independently. This can be an auditor's last in-person chance to engage with the staff to shape their perspective of the audit.</p>
<p>The debrief allows the auditor to ensure that they leave the host and its staff ready to start addressing their digital security. By providing some immediate outcomes to the host and its staff, and in combination with training or security consultation in the Responsive Support section, the auditor can ensure that the host sees the audit as a guide instead of a condemnation.</p>

<p>Follow up can be a valuable tool for encouraging an organization to continue their digital security process. But, follow up needs to be desired by an organization and achievable for the auditor. As such, follow up must be minimally intrusive on both the auditor and the host's time.</p>

<li id="fn50"><p>&quot;Penetration testing also poses a high risk to the organization’s networks and systems because it uses real exploits and attacks against production systems and data. Because of its high cost and potential impact, penetration testing of an organization’s network and systems on an annual basis may be sufficient. Also, penetration testing can be designed to stop when the tester reaches a point when an additional action will cause damage.&quot; - <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-115/SP800-115.pdf#page=40">NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment</a><a href="#fnref50">↩</a></p></li>

While staff need not become technical experts, CSOs should attempt to raise the awareness of every staff member, from executive directors to interns - groups are only as strong as their weakest link—so that they can spot issues, reduce vulnerabilities, know where to go for further help, and educate others.&quot;</a><a href="#fnref54">↩</a></p></li>
