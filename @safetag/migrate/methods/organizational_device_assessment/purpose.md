Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides, including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not overlooked.
