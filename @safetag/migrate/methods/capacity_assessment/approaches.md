 * Conduct pre-audit interviews with key managerial and technical staff to identify organizational areas of strength and weakness (expertise, finance, staff time, etc.).
 * Have informal conversations with staff during the course of the audit to further gather capacity and historical "stories" of technology adoption.
 * Generate easy to follow capacity self-assessment checklist, which can be continuously used and modified by the organisation over time.
