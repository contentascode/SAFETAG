 * What is the organization's ability to adopt new technologies or practices?
 * What resources does the organization have available to them?
 * What is the environment that the organization works within like? What barriers, threat actors, and other aspects influence their work?
 * Are there any specific considerations for the audit that would require modifying the overall approach, tools, preparation steps, or timeline?
