The main outputs of advanced threats identification should be evidence like files, emails, screenshots and URLs included in messages or spotted in suspicious connections.

* Identification and initial triage/analysis of suspicious processes, files, and emails (via Anti-Virus scanning results, MISP and Virustotal information, network traffic analysis, and other research)
* Useful evidence for further analysis (including hard disk image, memory image, suspicious files, emails, network traffic captures, URLs).
