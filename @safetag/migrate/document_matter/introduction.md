## Introduction

The Security Auditing Framework and Evaluation Template for Advocacy Groups (SAFETAG) is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to small, non-profit, human rights organizations based or operating in the developing world, taking into account the capacity constraints and unique threats faced in this community.

SAFETAG uses assessment activities derived from standards in the security auditing world and best-practices for working with small scale at-risk organizations to provide organization driven risk assessment and mitigation consultation. SAFETAG auditors lead an organizational risk modeling process that helps staff and leadership take an institutional lens on their digital security problems, conduct a targeted digital security audit to expose vulnerabilities that impact the vital processes and assets identified, and provide post-audit reporting and follow up that helps the organization and staff identify the training and technical support that they need to address needs identified in the audit, and in the future.
