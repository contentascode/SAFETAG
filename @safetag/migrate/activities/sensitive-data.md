# Sensitive Data

## Summary

Data and meta-data about an organization and its staff is incredibly difficult to keep track of over time, as people or projects use cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive for some activities, a shared server for others, and a mix of work and personal devices (laptops, phones, tablets...).  

This is natural, but it is important to keep track of where your organization's data lives and who can access it.


## Materials Needed

* Stickies and markers for activities
* Flip chart paper or a whiteboard 
* Camera to record outputs digitally

## Operational Security

* Some of the stickies generated in this activity may provide sensitive data, dispose of them responsibly.
* If you take photos for reporting needs, save the image files in a secure, encrypted container.
