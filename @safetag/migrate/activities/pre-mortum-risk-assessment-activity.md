# Risk Modeling Using the Pre-Mortum Strategy

## Summary

The pre-mortum strategy was devised to take participants out of a perspective of defending their plans and strategies and shielding themselves from flaws. They are given "a perspective where they [are] actively searching for flaws in their own plan." [^pre-mortum]. 


## Materials Needed

* Stickies (in multiple colors)
* Whiteboard or flip-chart
* Markers
* Camera to digitally capture the data

## Operational Security

  * Treat risk modeling data with the utmost security
  * Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.
  * Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.

## Recommendation

This activity can lead to feelings of hopelessness as well as stir up direct fears or challenges that the staff face. It is important to remind the staff that any risk can be mitigated, and indeed it is the goal of an audit to identify the highest priority ones based on actual likelihood and provide guidance on mitigation.
