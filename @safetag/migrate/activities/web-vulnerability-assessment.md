# Web Vulnerability Assessment

## Summary

Organizational websites are often a central part of their work, but resource constraints can leave them vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks, from simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to being leveraged for online scams and malicious advertisin to targeted distruction and subversion. Insecure websites can even be used in "watering hole" attacks where malware is implanted into the site to intentionally target the website's audience.

This activity provides a SAFETAG auditor with a suite of processes and tools to investigate organization and project websites for potential vulnerabilities.  There are multiple ways to do this, from passive to more active scanning. SAFETAG takes great care to take a primarily passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns. Care should be taken to review operational security concerns, work closely with the organization, and pursue a minimal approach focused on the priorities of the organization. See also the Vulnerability Scanning activity for additional tools and approaches useful for investigating outside of the website itself the server level.



## Operational Security

* Begin with passive techniques and consider if more detail is necessary (e.g. would simply upgrading the CMS solve multiple problems). Remember that the point is to create a clear, simple path towards security, not a comprehensive report on every possible vulnerability
* Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
* Agree on the site(s) to scan and determine the intensity of the process
* Ensure documented permission and schedule an appropriate time with the site host.
* In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the website. Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.
* Understand, discover and review the backup options the website has before starting the audit process.

## Walkthrough

Performing web vulnerability assessment can be done in different ways, using different tools and having different results. Choosing any of these steps or guides must not confuse an auditor, but instead, provide a broader scope which should help them finding vulnerabilities as many as they can.

These vulnerabilities can range from:
- Web Server/OS level vulnerabilities
- Access control vulnerabilities
- Application-specific vulnerabilities
- Misconfiguration
- SQL Injection
- Cross-site Scripting
- Directory Traversal
- Failure to restrict URL Access
- Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
- LDAP Injections
- Malicious Codes
- Leaked information

Before pursuing any of these more active scans, review outputs from passive reconnsaisance, DNS history and current information, and (if relevant) CMS version checking. This guide covers a small subset of web vulnerability scanning tools, a more comprehensive list is available at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools which may provide approaches better suited to specific situations.

OpenVAS, covered in the vulnerablity scanning activity, also includes Wapiti, which can help to detect many of the above common vulnerablitites.
