<h1 id="wps-pin-cracking">WPS PIN Cracking</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>WPS was built as an addition to WPA to make it easier to add devices without typing in secure passwords, but this ease of use means that a malicious actor can pose as a device and effectively reduce the potentially very difficult passwords WPA allows down to a simple numeric-only 8 character PIN. Further, the WPS system allows an attacker to work on this PIN in two parallel chunks, further reducing its security. This, like WEP, is a &quot;live&quot; attack - you have to stay connected to the network - but also like WEP, it is a guaranteed attack; your brute forcing of the WPS system will eventually (2-10 hours) allow you network access.</p>

<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
<p>WPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled temporarily to add new devices to the network.</p>
