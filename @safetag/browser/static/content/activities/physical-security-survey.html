<h1 id="operational-security-survey">Operational Security Survey</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This activity helps the auditor assess the organization's current operational security policies and practices through in-person or remote surveys and/or interviews. By also requesting to review and official policies as well as conducting multiple iterations of this with different staff members, some basic verification of the practices and awareness/understanding of existing policies can be achieved</p>
<h2 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>(optional) Survey system with appropriate security precautions and access controls</li>
<li>Note-taking device that can be secured.</li>
<li>For remote support, a secure videochat system (such as Signal) which works with the available bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operational-security">Operational Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.</li>
<li>Consider the threat context if an online survey tool is used to collect information and manage data access and storage responsibly.</li>
<li>Any remote communication on physical security should be done over secured channels from a private space</li>
<li>It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security. This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>This activity should build on the preparation work of the auditor, as well as the capacity assessment and context research work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Assessment:</strong> If the auditor has already completed the Capacity Assessment interview, many of the answers from its introductory &quot;Open Up&quot; questions (5-22) provide threat history, likelihood, and some basic policy information, and the questions grouped as &quot;Threat Information,&quot; (58-68) go deeper into previous problems and responses. If those were not asked, they can be included here as a follow-up interview/survey.</li>
<li><strong>Context Research:</strong> Ensure context research has revealed whether the organization would be targeted by adversaries due to their work (e.g. advocacy, engagement in or media coverage of socially sensitive topics, etc.). Threat identification and technical context research should provide insight into likely technical capabilities of adversaries (are malware or other surillance tools used (<a href="https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/" class="uri">https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/</a>) ? Physical surveillance/monitoring? Keyloggers?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an initial interview or survey has taken place (as part of capacity assessment or dedicated to the above-mentioned questions), Send a follow-up request for any policies mentioned or referred to (travel policies, onboarding/offboarding policies for staff changes, personal device usage (&quot;BYOD&quot;) policies, etc.). After reviewing those documents, request any additional policies those may refer to (general IT or security policies), and/or schedule a follow up interview or informal survey to dig deeper into remaining unanswered questions on the operatioal security situation of the organization as well as their adaptations to it. In the (likely) case where there are no policies governing these topics, the auditor can ask their points of contact for these discussions what the general practices are and expand and verify this through additional activities.</p>
<p>In creating new questions, be careful to not &quot;lead&quot; on security in a way that would discourage honest and transparent responses. For example, ask &quot;Do you host community events and trainings?&quot; instead of &quot;Do you allow outside people into your office&quot;?</p>
<p>Below are questions not already covered in the capacity assessment interview process, and after that selected questions from that process which are of particular use here.</p>
<p><strong>Office layout and proximity concerns</strong></p>
<p>Describe your office - is it on a floor of a building? An entire floor? (What level of the building?) How close are other buildings? Is it a shared, open office space or co-working space? (shared network? open access?)?</p>
<p>Has the organization dealt with robberies/theft, break-ins, or office raids? If so, what happened, when, and how did you respond (or do you have a policy or contingency plan? When was that last reviewed/updated?)</p>
