<h1 id="password-security-survey">Password Security Survey</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Weak and &quot;shared&quot; passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; remain the most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>
<h2 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>A prepared Password Survey (given sensitivity and need for anonymity, consider printing and then shredding/burning).</li>
<li>The Level Up Activity, <a href="https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords/activity-discussion/password-reverse-race/">Password Reverse Race</a> provides a staff activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the organization. Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to gather this information. The earlier questions are more important in terms of getting a sense of password practices, so consider adapting or shortening the survey based on staff/leadership buy-in and risk considerations.</p>
