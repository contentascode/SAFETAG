<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Incident Response setups up a procedure for identifying what counts as an incident during an audit, as well as incident handling and response in the event that auditor cause or uncover a security incident during the course of the assessment. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to know these procedures in handling incidents to protect data integrity and audit trail to be used for investigation and collection of information.</p>
<h2 id="operational-security">Operational Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Having an established emergency contact through the agreement process is critical</li>
<li>A clear understanding of the legal and technical context from the Context Research method will be critical in choosing how to proceed.</li>
<li>Consider moving sensitive conversations to a separate, offsite location.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>What counts as an incident should be agreed with the organization's management during the agreement phase, and should include possibilities informed by the Context and Technical Research work.</p>
<p>Incidents can include problems such as insider threats, active remote access malware systems, or the discovery of physical surveillance of the office, as well as many other possibilities. The auditor must use their best judgement along the SAFETAG Auditor Code of Conduct, their agreement with the organization, personal ethics, legal reponsibilities, and balance this in the frame of the organization's context, capacity, and the need to in good faith gain the trust of the staff of the organization to fulfill a successful audit.</p>
