<h1 id="accessing-a-mac-filtered-network">Accessing a MAC-filtered Network</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Open and MAC-address-filtered wireless access points are not only open to anyone within range to join and listen in to, but also do not provide protection to those on the network itself, even if they do not &quot;broadcast&quot; their name. These may seem like great ways to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your network without resorting to passwords, but they are trivial to overcome.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>The auditor can easily gain access to an open or MAC address filtered access point.</p>
<ul>
<li>MAC-Address Spoofing
<ul>
<li>Start the wireless interface in monitor mode</li>
<li>Identify MAC addresses that are on the whitelist</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">airodump-ng</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>* Change our MAC address to one that’s on the whitelist</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">ifconfig</span> mon0 down
<span class="ex">macchanger</span> -m [MAC ADDRESS IDENTIFIED] mon0

<p>Transitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks, is recommended.</p>
