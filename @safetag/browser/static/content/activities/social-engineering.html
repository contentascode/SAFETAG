<p>This component allows the auditor to gauge staff awareness of social engineering risks. The staff take part in activities to explore what phishing look like based on sample &quot;phishing campaign&quot; style emails sent by the auditor as examples. The auditor and staff will discuss the consequences of having their devices compromised.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use “live” malware in this component. It is tempting to conduct an audit that more closely resembles a penetration test than a vulnerability assessment to expose the dangers of social engineering attacks. Distributing live malware and requires a much higher level of skill and comprehensive understanding of the deployed exploits in order to avoid possible service disruption.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participants are better able to identify possible phishing attempts.</li>
<li>Participants have a better understanding of how malware on one machine exposes organizational data.</li>
