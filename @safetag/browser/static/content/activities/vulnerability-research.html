<ul>
<li>Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.</li>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>After completing an automated vulnerability scan (network, system, webapp) and documenting findings, you can now move into vulnerability research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing your findings by researching on public vulnerability Databases about the vulnerability that you have found.</li>
<li>Identify and enumerate risks involved for a certain vulnerability</li>
<li>Formulate a mitigation plan or recommendations<br />
Below is a list of some of the most common vulnerability databases:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">National Vulnerability Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com">Exploit Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db">Rapid 7 Vulnerability &amp; Exploit Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.securityfocus.com/bid">SecurityFocus BugTraq Database</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://wpvulndb.com">WPScan Vulnerability Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://packetstormsecurity.com">PacketStorm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com">CVEDetails</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls">KB CERT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vulnerabilitycenter.com/#search">Skybox Security</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Validation:<br />
Each of your findings, once reviewed and documented will be enough for your report. However, if you and the organization agreed to verify findings and vulnerability truly exist, you may refer to Penetration Testing resources within SAFETAG framework.</p>
<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lists of OVAL/CVE identifiers for each possibly vulnerable service/system.</li>
<li>Examples of live exploits for vulnerabilities where possible.</li>
<li>A short write up of each vulnerability including how it was identified.</li>
<li>The cleaned up output from any tests used to identify the vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
