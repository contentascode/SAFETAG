<p>This component allows the auditor to quickly identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.</p>
<h2 id="operational-security">Operational Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use VPNs to do automated searching. The automated process can be misconstrued by various services as malicious and cause your local network to get blocked, filtered, or surveilled. Tor is often blocked by the tools you will be using.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Both Recon-ng and Foca are open source reconnaissance tools with many available plugins. Foca is, out-of-the-box, more aimed at extracting metadata from documents and images, whereas Recon is slightly more focused on finding digging into domains, subdomains, contacts, and the more network-level information. Both tools are best used in addition to critical thinking and manual exploration, and require &quot;seed&quot; inputs to get started and careful curation to remove false leads.</p>
