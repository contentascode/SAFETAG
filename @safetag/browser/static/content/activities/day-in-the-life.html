<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software runing on computers and its current version. The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.</p>
<p>This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="operational-security">Operational Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.</p></li>
<li><p>If using screen sharing, use a service with transport security and &quot;lock&quot; the room or make sure the user knows to end the call if anyone unexpected joins the room (unlikely)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist activity), also interview them about the other devices they use, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.</p>
<p>This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a screensharing tool (meet.jit.si or appear.in offer easy-to-use, browser based options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what applications are active in the background.</p>
