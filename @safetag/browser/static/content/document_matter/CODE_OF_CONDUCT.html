<h3 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement:</h3>
<p>The mission of the SAFETAG community is to improve the security of civil society organizations around the world.</p>
<p>What we do: The community collaborates actively to share knowledge, build capacity, and create resources, while promoting transparency and accountability amongst its members, as well as with other communities of practice.</p>
<h3 id="community-standards">Community Standards</h3>
<p>The SAFETAG Community of Practice (SCoP) will a be a closed and private group, initially housed within the existing orgsec.community listserv.</p>
<ul>
<li>Community members are encouraged to be active - positively contributing / leading discussions on community channels, creating, curating, or peer-reviewing content or contributing to the issue queue. There will be an annual &quot;introduction&quot; thread on the listserv where all SCoP members are expected to respond with a short note on current (shareable) activities.</li>
<li>Some SCoP members may have privacy concerns, and should join the community using a pseudonym they are comfortable with engaging online in both public and private spaces with.</li>
<li>Joining the community: While housed within the orgsec.community, the SCoP will follow the joining process on that list.</li>
<li>The SCoP is responsible for adhering to the SAFETAG Code of Conduct, below</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="safetag-code-of-conduct">SAFETAG Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>Members of the SAFETAG community are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect the auditees, their contexts (including the legal framework they operate within), and protect their privacy and security</li>
<li>Protect the identifying information and audit findings of your auditees, unless you have full, informed consent of the auditee -- and even then, exercise extreme care.</li>
<li>Never use your knowledge, skills and/or access to do harm against organizations or communities you are working with or your peer auditors through malice or neglect</li>
<li>Minimize any conflict of interests through transparency in your contracting, reporting, and recommendations; e.g. if you were not hired initially to implement recommendations, suggest options other than yourself for implementation, and provide reporting that would enable that to be a success in every case.</li>
<li>Perform your job responsibly and well. Ask and consult with fellow members of the community.</li>
<li>Respect other members of the community as peers and promote a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="community-manager">Community Manager</h4>
<p>There will be, given that funds are available, a paid <strong>community manager</strong> who has at least a quarter of their time to support the SAFETAG community and contribute to and support the broader community around NGO organizational security. This community manager should rotate among organizations implementing substantial organizational security work. There may be gaps and/or overlaps due to project and staff funding requirements; it is important for implementing organizations to coordinate funding this position in order to minimize this.</p>
