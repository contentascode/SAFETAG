<h4 id="guiding-questions">Guiding Questions</h4>
<p>Each audit objective is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization.</p>
<h4 id="approaches">Approaches</h4>
