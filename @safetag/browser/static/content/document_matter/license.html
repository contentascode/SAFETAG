<h3 id="usage-of-safetag">Usage of &quot;SAFETAG&quot;</h3>
<p>SAFETAG is itself a framework and template for organizational audits. As such, audits performed which use or adapt SAFETAG materials may be referred to as &quot;adapting the SAFETAG methodology&quot; or &quot;based on the SAFETAG framework&quot;, and similar phrasings, but may NOT be called &quot;SAFETAG audits&quot;.</p>
<p>This is not intended to imply that an audit using any or all of the SAFETAG materials need to refer to SAFETAG at all.</p>
<p>This usage policy does not affect the distribution of SAFETAG materials, covered in the license statement above.</p>
