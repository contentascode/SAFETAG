<p>This SAFETAG curricula uses the ADIDS approach to adult learning.</p>
<p>&quot;ADIDS stands for Activity-Discussion-Input-Deepening-Synthesis. It is one of the teaching methodologies for adult learning – there are others, but for our purposes we’re going to focus on this one in this module. ADIDS is frequently used in awareness-raising workshops on specific social issues. The assumption behind ADIDS is that learning and awareness-raising happens in stages, and we cannot expect a person to learn everything about an issue in one go, or in one lecture. Instead, the learning process takes time. For digital safety training, which mixes both awareness-raising on issues and teaching technical and strategic solutions, the ADIDS methodology is a good fit. (For additional background, we recommend you read our brief background informing the ADIDS methodology, <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/before-an-event/levelups-approach-to-adult-learning">How Adults Learn</a>.)&quot; -- <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/before-an-event/preparing-sessions-using-adids/">LevelUp: Preparing ADIDS Sessions</a></p>
<p>Each training session is designed to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>A</strong>ctivity, (which includes a</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>iscussion about that activity),</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nput (related lecture or background material),</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>eepening (the hands-on portion of the session), and</li>
<li>a <strong>S</strong>ynthesis (wrap-up, review, and Q&amp;A).</li>
