<ul>
<li>An agreement on capturing data in infected devices should be signed with the organization before this step.</li>
<li>The auditor should ensure they have a clear understanding set with the organization on an incidence response plan, points of contact, and process to allow for safe discussions.</li>
<li>Dealing with malicious software is risky, you have to be aware of the threats around it, don’t infect yourself or more machines.</li>
<li>Don't upload files to third party services (use hashes). Take extreme care with identifying or potentially targeted information.</li>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.</li>
<li>For severe infections or incidents, the auditor and the organization may agree, through the Incident Response Plan, to clean or reformat critical devices. This is extremely time consuming, and may result in the loss of data, critical programs where the installation media/license has been lost, and potential re-infection. Proceed with extreme caution and clarity.</li>
