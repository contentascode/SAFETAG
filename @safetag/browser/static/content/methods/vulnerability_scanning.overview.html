<p>This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network, however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to run critical infrastructure themselves on available equipment. A better-resourced organization may host its critical services at a remote data center, or outsource its IT infrastructure to cloud providers, such as Google Apps, and/or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). Regardless, it is rare to have someone designated to update and patch systems as vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as opposed to availability -- standpoint.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Run vulnerability scans against websites, externally facing servers, and key intranet servers.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Vulnerability Databases:</strong> Search vulnerability databases for potential risks to systems and software used on servers, user devices, and online services.</li>
<li><strong>Examine Service Configuration Files:</strong> Examine configuration files for vulnerabilities using &quot;hardening&quot;, or &quot;common mistake&quot; guides found online.</li>
