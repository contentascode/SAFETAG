<p>The remote assessment methodology focuses on direct observation of an organization and their infrastructure, consisting of passive reconnaissance of publicly available data sources (&quot;Open Source Intelligence&quot;) This allows the auditor to identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.</p>

<p>While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around the office, unintended information available from &quot;open sources&quot; can pose real threats and deserve significant attention. This also builds the Auditor's understanding of the organization's digital presence and will guide specific vulnerabilities to investigate once on site.</p>
