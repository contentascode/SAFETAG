<p>Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides, including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not overlooked.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Access to Devices:</strong> Tour the office and look for logged in devices without users, servers, network jacks, written down passwords and document how difficult it would be for a visitor or after-hours break-in to access sensitive systems. Have staff take a physical security security</li>
<li><strong>Conduct a Hands on Device Interview/Audit:</strong> Inspect and record information on user devices (work &amp; personal) for security concerns (existance of passwords, patch levels, user privileges, drive encryption, ports/services running, anti-virus capabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Password User Survey:</strong> Have staff take the password use survey for ALL devices used for work. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>A Day In the Life:</strong> Have staff walk you through a usual &quot;day in their life&quot; showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they have to interact with to conduct their work.</li>
