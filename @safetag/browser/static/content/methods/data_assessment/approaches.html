<ul>
<li><strong>Data Mapping Activity:</strong> Have staff identify where that data is currently (what devices/physical locations), who has access (physical, login, permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Data Lost and Found Activity:</strong> Have rank the impact if different data within the organization was lost, and if adversaries gained access to that data.</li>
<li><strong>Private Data Activity:</strong> Guide staff through an activity to have them list private data within the organization [^personal_information_to_keep_private]</li>
</ul>
<p>If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches described in the <a href="#appendix-remote-facilitation">Remote Facilitation</a> appendix.</p>
