<li>How can you prepare the staff and management for aspects of the audit process might lead to alienation or inhibit the process?</li>
<li>What is the organization's readiness and likelihood to succeed in engaging with security technology? What factors will complicate or inhibit the effective and safe uptake and use?</li>
<li>Is the support you want to provide (troubleshooting, fixes, upgrades, training, etc.) critical to the security of the organization? If not, can you provide that support without taking away from the audit?</li>

<li>For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your intervention.</li>
