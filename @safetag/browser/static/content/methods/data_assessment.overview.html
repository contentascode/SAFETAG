<p>Sensitive files are often stored across multiple devices with different levels of security. A data assessment allows the auditor to recommend secure storage solutions which best meet the organizations risk assessment and workflow needs. While the auditor has insight on some of this based on the Network Access and Network Mapping work, cross-staff understanding and agreement on what constitutes sensitive data will support later organizational change.</p>
<p>An adversary who obtains a laptop, workstation, or backup drive will be able to read or modify sensitive information on the device, even if that staff member has set a strong account password. This applies to threats involving loss, theft, and confiscation, but also to &quot;checkpoint&quot; scenarios in which they may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a burglary or office raid, an adversary could obtain all sensitive information on the organization's devices, possibly even undetected.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Mapping Activity:</strong> Have staff identify where that data is currently (what devices/physical locations), who has access (physical, login, permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Data Lost and Found Activity:</strong> Have rank the impact if different data within the organization was lost, and if adversaries gained access to that data.</li>
<li><strong>Private Data Activity:</strong> Guide staff through an activity to have them list private data within the organization <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches described in the <a href="#appendix-remote-facilitation">Remote Facilitation</a> appendix.</p>
