<p>A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and respond to its findings.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<!-- Following snippet transcluded from document_matter/preparation/approaches.md with resolveMetalsmith.url(../document_matter/preparation/approaches.md) {} -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Create an Assessment Plan:</strong> Have a &quot;scoping&quot; meeting that outlines the level of access that an auditor will have, what is off limits, and the process for modifying the scope of the audit when new information arises. <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Negotiate a Confidentiality Agreement:</strong> Negotiate an agreement with the organization that outlines how an auditor will protect the privacy of the organization and the outcomes of the audit.</li>
<li><strong>Establish an Emergency Contact:</strong> Establish a procedure for incident handling and an emergency contact in the event that auditor cause or uncover an incident during the course of the assessment. <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Conduct Research</strong> (See <a href="#context-research">Context Research</a>) to identify potential adversaries and their capabilities, and explore the latest cyber security and topical trends, to assess risk for the auditing process itself.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare for Travel:</strong> Check travel logistical needs -- visa, letter of invitation, travel tickets and hotel reservations. Note that some visas can take significant effort and may require the auditor to be without a passport while they are being processed.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare Systems:</strong> Update and test your systems, A/V and audit tools<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, prepare storage devices and systems to reflect the required operational security, and ensure you have power supply adapters, cables and relevant adapters, usb drives, external wireless cards and any other equipment needed for testing. <a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
