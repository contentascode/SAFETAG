<li>Are there documented policies or practices, including any employee onboarding guidance?</li>
<li>What is the level of formality of the security practices in place? are verbal conventions, written documents or something in between?</li>
<li>What is the understanding by the management and/or staff on common security practices?</li>
<li>Are there presumptions being made by some staff which are not shared?</li>
<li>How are any of these implemented / required / verified within existing organizational practice?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Password expectations (password management, complexity, requirements</li>
<li>entry/exit policies and account management</li>
<li>information classification that limits access (e.g. who has access to financial data? partner data?)</li>
<li>Backups</li>
<li>Acceptable use policies (what can and cannot staff do with their work devices)</li>
<li>Travel policies (VPN usage, etc.)</li>
</ul>
