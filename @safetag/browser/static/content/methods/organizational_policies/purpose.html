<p>Many smaller organizations do not have formal policies around information security. This is not inherently a good or bad thing, as in their place are often informal agreements and practices. The goal of this component is to reveal any presumptions that are not shared, and help set more formalized agreements across the organization, and to cross-verify these policies, practices, guidelines, and informal agreements with what is actually taking place (generally using activities from data assessment and device assessment methodologies).</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify what (if any) baseline policies or informal agreements exist to respond to common information security and business continuity challenges</li>
<li>Clarify any presumptions being made but not effectively shared</li>
<li>List of existing agreements and gaps?</li>
<li>Resources to formalize/expand agreements to policies</li>
<li>Onboarding checklist (entry/exit policies?)</li>
</ul>
