<ul>
<li><strong>Conduct a Hands on Device Interview/Audit:</strong> Inspect and record information on user devices (work &amp; personal) for security concerns (patch levels, user privileges, drive encryption, ports/services running, anti-virus capabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Password User Survey:</strong> Have staff take the password use survey for ALL devices used for work. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>A Day In the Life:</strong> Have staff walk you through a usual &quot;day in their life&quot; showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they have to interact with to conduct their work.</li>
