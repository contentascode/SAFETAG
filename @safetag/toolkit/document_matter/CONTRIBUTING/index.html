<p>SAFETAG welcomes contributions!</p>
<p>SAFETAG is a community-managed product with an advisory board and community management roles laid out in our <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a> further outlines expectations of not only those using the content herein but also those contributing to it. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.</p>
<p>When submitting new content, please write in clear, concise, and gender neutral language. This document will be updated with guidance on content translation once we have settled on a process for that. If you would like to submit content in a language other than English or Spanish, please open an issue to set that language up for submission.</p>
<h3 id="getting-starting">Getting Starting</h3>
<p>Before you start work, it is critically important to review the current content and existing <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues">issues</a> and <strong>create a new issue for your proposed work</strong> to solicit feedback -- this will save you a lot of time as the SAFETAG community can help refine your idea and advise on where best to include it in the framework (is it a new method? An activity or variant? Is there existing content in SAFETAG to update or improve?), as well as suggest additional resources worth considering, operational security and safety considerations.</p>
<p>You can also join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/humansafetag/shared_invite/enQtNDM4MDIwNzM0NTc3LTYzM2Y4YjIyZmY2ZjhiODZjZDE0ODhmYzgwMTZmMjU2MTA2NDdjMTM2M2U4ODk1OWMzZThkMmI5OGY3MjFiM2M">public slack</a> to discuss changes and ask questions to the community.</p>
<h3 id="content-creation-guidelines">Content Creation Guidelines</h3>
<p><em>This section helps walk you though how SAFETAG is constructed, and what pieces of content are important to provide in a submission. Submissions which do not follow these guidelines will take significantly longer to be incorporated.</em></p>
<p>SAFETAG has currently three main compiled products - an <strong>overview guide</strong>, the <strong>full guide</strong>, and a <strong>curricula</strong> to help train new auditors. This guide is primarily focused on the non-curricular SAFTAG content. The Curricula is an ADIDS-based approach to training on SAFETAG content (read more about the curricula content at <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template" class="uri">https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/wiki/Curricula-Document-Template</a></p>
<p>The SAFETAG overview is the easiest place to start. The full guide is a comprehensive collection of not only the method-based objectives of the audit, but a variety of specific activities an auditor might choose to use and combine to achieve those. Both of these are built from the collection of Methods and Activities that make up SAFETAG.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, <strong>Methods</strong> are high-level, goal-focused aspects of the assessment. There are inevitable &quot;fuzzy&quot; borders between some methods. Creation of new methods should be minimized to not overly complicate the scope of SAFETAG.</p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong> are the meat of an audit, and answer &quot;how&quot; and &quot;where&quot; type questions. To accomplish the goals of a method, one might conduct multiple activities to explore and verify organization practices from different angles - research, policy review, conversations / discussions, and technical verification, exploration, and scanning.</p>
<p>Within both Methods and Activities are smaller chunks of content which are used across the full range of SAFETAG &quot;products.&quot; The tables below map out what content chunks exist across which products, and what they are. The <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates">Templates</a> folder has sub-folders which provide the default files and indices for methods and activities.</p>
<p><strong>SAFETAG is in the process of being rebuilt in a more interactive, meta-data driven interface at <a href="https://github.com/contentascode/safetag" class="uri">https://github.com/contentascode/safetag</a>. The current structure will be migrated into this format, and updates to the process will be posted here.</strong></p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-safetag-method">Creating a new SAFETAG Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Getting Started instructions above.</li>
<li>Decide on a name for the method, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). If your new method is &quot;Creating SAFETAG Content&quot;, the folder would be <em>en/methods/creating_safetag_content</em>.</li>
<li>Copy the Method <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates">template</a> files from <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method" class="uri">https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/method</a> into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.</li>
<li>Create index files for your method: In addition to the content files below, each Method must also have two index files, a method_name.guide.md and a method_name.overview.md . The contents of these index files are generally the same for every method, and templates exist at <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders" class="uri">https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New methods must be lined into the master index file, and must have activities linked to them.</strong> To link the new method into the master index file (and therefore have the method &quot;included&quot; in the &quot;master&quot; SAFETAG build, these index files must be linked into the relevant master index file in the language folder (<em>en/index.guide.md</em> and <em>en/index.overview.md</em>). See below for how Activities are linked in to the methods.</p>
<h4 id="method-content-notes">Method Content notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to focus on creating Activities rather than Methods.</li>
<li>All Methods must have all of the content listed below unless marked as &quot;optional&quot;.</li>
<li>All Methods must have at least one activity associated with them.</li>
<li>Ideally, also create curricula content for each Method, or at least notes for someone training on the topic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="method-section-and-stylistic-notes">Method Section and Stylistic notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Methods should operate at header 2 and 3. The Method title is h2, and the major subheadings (below) are h3. No additional header levels should be used.</li>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-safetag-activity">Creating a new SAFETAG Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Getting Started instructions above.</li>
<li>Decide on a name for the activity, and create the a corresponding folder (lowercased, with _ replacing spaces). Activity contents live in the exercises folder under the language folder, so <em>en/exercise/exercise_name/...</em>). If your new activity is &quot;Using atom to edit SAFETAG markdown files&quot;, the folder would be something like <em>en/exercises/using_atom/</em> .</li>
<li>Copy the Activity <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates">template</a> files from <a href="https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity" class="uri">https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates/folders/activity</a> into the method folder. The content of these files is described below.</li>
<li>Activity contents also have an index file (within the same folder, not above it as with methods). The index file needs to be updated with the title of the activity but is otherwise the same across most activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New activities must be linked to a method.</strong> To link an activity to a method, please update both the activities.md file in the method folder, and also add it directly to index.guide.md under the method. The current build process uses the index.guide.md link, but for content tracking, it's best to update both. If adding an activity to multiple methods, select a primary method where it is the most relevant to that method's outputs, and for additional methods, link it in following this format:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;div class=&quot;boxtext&quot;&gt;

This should provide concise guidance at a peer level for the general steps an auditor should take, but should point to, not re-create existing documentation. For technical aspects, ideal walkthroughs should enable IT staff/contractors to follow along and verify fixes.

<h4 id="activity-variants">Activity variants</h4>
<p>In some cases, one activity will have many parallel ways to achieve the goal this is often the case with technical activities where there is a collection of similar tools all focused on the same overall outcome. In cases like these, it is best to create <em>Activity Variants</em> instead of new activities. This lets different auditors select and use tools and approaches they are most comfortable with, while still operating within the larger SAFETAG framework.</p>
<p>To use variants, you will create files in the activity's folder that begin with variant_, and link them in from the instructions.md file. The variant_ files should not use any header formatting.</p>
<p>In your instructions.md file, begin by introducing any common, cross-variant instructions or guidance not covered in other activity sections, and summarize each variant. At the end of the instructions text, add the following for each variant, updating the title and file name to the specific variant:</p>
<pre><code> ___

 !INCLUDE &quot;variant_descriptive_file_name.md&quot;</code></pre>
